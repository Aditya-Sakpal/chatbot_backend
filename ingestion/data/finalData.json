    "abstract": "DOPA Decarboxylase (DDC) has been proposed as a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker with increased concentrations in Lewy body disorders (LBDs) and highest levels in patients receiving dopaminergic treatment. Here we evaluate plasma DDC, measured by proximity extension assay, and the effect of dopaminergic treatment in three independent LBD (with a focus on dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD)) cohorts: an autopsy-confirmed cohort (n = 71), a large multicenter, cross-dementia cohort (n = 1498) and a longitudinal cohort with detailed treatment information (n = 66, median follow-up time[IQR] = 4[4, 4] years). Plasma DDC was not altered between different LBDs and other disease groups or controls in absence of treatment. DDC levels increased over time in PD, being significantly associated to higher dosages of dopaminergic treatment. This emphasizes the need to consider treatment effect when analyzing plasma DDC, and suggests that plasma DDC, in contrast to CSF DDC, is of limited use as a diagnostic biomarker for LBD, but could be valuable for treatment monitoring."

    "abstract": "Cardiomyocytes can be implanted to remuscularize the failing heart1-7. Challenges include sufficient cardiomyocyte retention for a sustainable therapeutic impact without intolerable side effects, such as arrhythmia and tumour growth. We investigated the hypothesis that epicardial engineered heart muscle (EHM) allografts from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and stromal cells structurally and functionally remuscularize the chronically failing heart without limiting side effects in rhesus macaques. After confirmation of in vitro and in vivo (nude rat model) equivalence of the newly developed rhesus macaque EHM model with a previously established Good Manufacturing Practice-compatible human EHM formulation8, long-term retention (up to 6 months) and dose-dependent enhancement of the target heart wall by EHM grafts constructed from 40 to 200 million cardiomyocytes/stromal cells were demonstrated in macaques with and without myocardial infarction-induced heart failure. In the heart failure model, evidence for EHM allograft-enhanced target heart wall contractility and ejection fraction, which are measures for local and global heart support, was obtained. Histopathological and gadolinium-based perfusion magnetic resonance imaging analyses confirmed cell retention and functional vascularization. Arrhythmia and tumour growth were not observed. The obtained feasibility, safety and efficacy data provided the pivotal underpinnings for the approval of a first-in-human clinical trial on tissue-engineered heart repair. Our clinical data confirmed remuscularization by EHM implantation in a patient with advanced heart failure."

    "abstract": "Background: The risk of developing advanced neoplasia (AN; colorectal cancer and/or high-grade dysplasia) in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with a low-grade dysplasia (LGD) lesion is variable and difficult to predict. This is a major challenge for effective clinical management.\nObjective: We aimed to provide accurate AN risk stratification in UC patients with LGD. We hypothesised that the pattern and burden of somatic genomic copy number alterations (CNAs) in LGD lesions could predict future AN risk.\nDesign: We performed a retrospective multicentre validated case-control study using n=270 LGD samples from n=122 patients with UC. Patients were designated progressors (n=40) if they had a diagnosis of AN in the ~5 years following LGD diagnosis or non-progressors (n=82) if they remained AN-free during follow-up. DNA was extracted from the baseline LGD lesion, low-coverage whole genome sequencing performed and data processed to detect CNAs. Survival analysis was used to evaluate CNAs as predictors of future AN risk.\nResults: CNA burden was significantly higher in progressors than non-progressors (p=2×10-6 in discovery cohort) and was a very significant predictor of AN risk in univariate analysis (OR=36; p=9×10-7), outperforming existing clinical risk factors such as lesion size, shape and focality. Optimal risk prediction was achieved with a multivariate model combining CNA burden with the known clinical risk factor of incomplete LGD resection. Within-LGD lesion genetic heterogeneity did not confound risk prediction.\nConclusion: Measurement of CNAs in LGD is an accurate predictor of AN risk in inflammatory bowel disease and is likely to support clinical management."

Participants in the frozen embryo transfer group had all of their embryos cryopreserved and underwent frozen embryo transfer later. Participants in the fresh embryo transfer group underwent fresh embryo transfer after oocyte retrieval.\nMain outcome measures: The primary outcome was live birth, defined as the delivery of neonates with a heartbeat and respiration at ≥28 weeks' gestation. Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, singleton or twin pregnancy, pregnancy loss, ectopic pregnancy, birth weight, maternal and neonatal complications, and cumulative live birth after embryo transfers within one year after randomisation.\nResults: In an intention-to-treat analysis, the rate of live birth was lower in the frozen embryo transfer group than in the fresh embryo transfer group (32% (132 of 419) v 40% (168 of 419); relative ratio 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.65 to 0.94); P=0.009). The frozen embryo group had a lower rate of clinical pregnancy than the fresh embryo group (39% (164 of 419) v 47% (197 of 419); 0.83 (0.71 to 0.97)). The cumulative live birth rate was lower in the frozen embryo transfer group compared with the fresh embryo transfer group (44% (185 of 419) v 51% (215 of 419), 0.86 (0.75 to 0.99)). No difference was observed in birth weight, incidence of obstetric complications, or risk of neonatal morbidities.\nConclusions: Fresh embryo transfer may be a better choice for women with low prognosis in terms of live birth rate compared with a freeze-all strategy. The treatment strategies that prevent fresh embryo transfers, such as accumulating embryos with back-to-back cycles or performing routine preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy, warrant further studies in women with a low prognosis.\nTrial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2100050168."

    "abstract": "Plasma phosphorylated tau biomarkers open unprecedented opportunities for identifying carriers of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology in early disease stages using minimally invasive techniques. Plasma p-tau biomarkers are believed to reflect tau phosphorylation and secretion. However, it remains unclear to what extent the magnitude of plasma p-tau abnormalities reflects neuronal network disturbance in the form of cognitive impairment. To address this question, we included 103 cognitively unimpaired elderly and 40 cognitively impaired, amyloid-β positive individuals from the TRIAD cohort, as well as 336 cognitively unimpaired and 216 cognitively impaired, amyloid-β positive older adults from the BioFINDER-2 cohort. Participants had tau PET scans, amyloid PET scans or amyloid CSF, p-tau217, p-tau181 and p-tau231 blood measures, structural T1-MRI and cognitive assessments. In this cross-sectional study, we used regression models and correlation analyses to assess the relationship between plasma biomarkers and cognitive scores. Furthermore, we applied receiver operating characteristic curves to assess cognitive impairment across plasma biomarkers. Finally, we categorized participants into amyloid (A), p-tau (T1), and tau PET (T2) positive (+) or negative (-) profiles and ran nonparametric comparisons to assess differences across cognitive domains. We found that plasma p-tau217 was more associated with cognitive performance than p-tau181 and p-tau231, and that this relationship was particularly strong for memory scores (TRIAD: βp-tau217=-0.53; βp-tau181=-0.35; βp-tau231=-0.24; BioFINDER-2: βp-tau217=-0.52; βp-tau181=-0.24; βp-tau231=-0.29). Associations in amyloid-β positive participants resembled these results, but other cognitive scores also showed strong associations in cognitively impaired individuals. Moreover, plasma p-tau217 outperformed plasma p-tau181 and plasma p-tau231 in identifying memory impairment (Area Under the Curve values for TRIAD: p-tau217=0.86, p-tau181=0.77, p-tau231=0.75; Area Under the Curve values for BioFINDER-2: p-tau217=0.86, p-tau181=0.76, p-tau231=0.81), and in identifying executive function impairment only in the BioFINDER-2 cohort (p-tau217=0.82, p-tau181=0.76, p-tau231=0.76). Lastly, we showed that subtle memory deficits were present in A+T1+T2- participants for plasma p-tau217 (p=0.007) and plasma p-tau181 (p=0.01) in the TRIAD cohort, and for all biomarkers across cognitive domains in A+T1-T2- and A+T1+T2- individuals (p<0.001 in all) in the BioFINDER-2 cohort. A+T1+T2+ individuals showed cognitive deficits in both cohorts (p<0.001 in all). Together, our results suggest that plasma p-tau217 stands out as a biomarker capable of identifying memory deficits due to Alzheimer's disease and that memory impairment certainly occurs in amyloid and plasma p-tau positive individuals that have no significant amounts of tau in the neocortex."

    "abstract": "Background: For decades, poor treatment options and low-quality evidence plagued care for patients with rifampin-resistant tuberculosis. The advent of new drugs to treat tuberculosis and enhanced funding now permit randomized, controlled trials of shortened-duration, all-oral treatments for rifampin-resistant tuberculosis.\nMethods: We conducted a phase 3, multinational, open-label, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial to compare standard therapy for treatment of fluoroquinolone-susceptible, rifampin-resistant tuberculosis with five 9-month oral regimens that included various combinations of bedaquiline (B), delamanid (D), linezolid (L), levofloxacin (Lfx) or moxifloxacin (M), clofazimine (C), and pyrazinamide (Z). Participants were randomly assigned (with the use of Bayesian response-adaptive randomization) to receive one of five combinations or standard therapy. The primary end point was a favorable outcome at week 73, defined by two negative sputum culture results or favorable bacteriologic, clinical, and radiologic evolution. The noninferiority margin was -12 percentage points.\nResults: Among the 754 participants who underwent randomization, 699 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, and 562 in the per-protocol analysis. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, 80.7% of the patients in the standard-therapy group had favorable outcomes. The risk difference between standard therapy and each of the four new regimens that were found to be noninferior in the modified intention-to-treat population was as follows: BCLLfxZ, 9.8 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 18.7); BLMZ, 8.3 percentage points (95% CI, -0.8 to 17.4); BDLLfxZ, 4.6 percentage points (95% CI, -4.9 to 14.1); and DCMZ, 2.5 percentage points (95% CI, -7.5 to 12.5). Differences were similar in the per-protocol population, with the exception of DCMZ, which was not noninferior in that population. The proportion of participants with grade 3 or higher adverse events was similar across the regimens. Grade 3 or higher hepatotoxic events occurred in 11.7% of participants overall and in 7.1% of those receiving standard therapy.\nConclusions: Consistent results across all the analyses support the noninferior efficacy of three all-oral shortened regimens for the treatment of rifampin-resistant tuberculosis.

    "abstract": "Background and objectives: Lipid metabolism in older adults is affected by various factors including biological aging, functional decline, reduced physiologic reserve, and nutrient intake. The dysregulation of lipid metabolism could adversely affect brain health. This study investigated the association between year-to-year intraindividual lipid variability and subsequent risk of cognitive decline and dementia in community-dwelling older adults.\nMethods: ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) was a randomized trial of aspirin, involving 19,114 participants aged 65 years and older from Australia and the United States who were free of dementia and major cognitive impairment. ASPREE-eXTension is the post-trial observational follow-up of participants, currently to a maximum of 11 years. This post hoc analysis included participants who had lipid levels measured at baseline and in years 1, 2, and 3. Year-to-year variability in total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and triglycerides over the first 3 years was quantified using variability independent of the mean. Individuals who initiated or discontinued lipid-lowering therapy during this period were excluded. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze associations with incident dementia, adjudicated by expert panels, and cognitive impairment with no dementia (CIND) confirmed by a battery of cognitive tests, occurring after year 3. A linear mixed model was used for assessing the association with changes in 4 cognitive function domains, including global, memory, processing speed, verbal fluency, and a composite score from baseline to the end of follow-up.\nResults: The analysis included 9,846 individuals (median [interquartile range] age: 73.9 [71.7-77.3] years, 54.9% female). 509 incident dementia and 1,760 CIND events were recorded over a median follow-up of 5.8 and 5.4 years after variability assessment. The hazard ratios (95% CI) comparing the highest and lowest quartiles of TC and LDL-c variability were 1.60 (1.23-2.08) and 1.48 (1.15-1.91) for dementia and 1.23 (1.08-1.41) and 1.27 (1.11-1.46) for CIND. Higher TC and LDL-c variability was also associated with a faster decline in global cognition, episodic memory, psychomotor speed, and the composite score (all p < 0.001). No strong evidence was found for an association of HDL-c and triglyceride variability with dementia and cognitive change.\nDiscussion: Tracking variability of TC and LDL-c may serve as a novel biomarker of incident dementia and cognitive decline in older adults."

    "abstract": "Sleep alterations have been described in several neurodegenerative diseases yet are currently poorly characterized in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This study investigates sleep macroarchitecture and related hypothalamic signaling disruptions in ALS. Using polysomnography, we found that both patients with ALS as well as asymptomatic C9ORF72 and SOD1 mutation carriers exhibited increased wakefulness and reduced non-rapid eye movement sleep. Increased wakefulness correlated with diminished cognitive performance in both clinical cohorts. Similar changes in sleep macroarchitecture were observed in three ALS mouse models (Sod1G86R, FusΔNLS/+, and TDP43Q331K). A single oral administration of a dual-orexin receptor antagonist or intracerebroventricular delivery of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) through an osmotic pump over 15 days partially normalized sleep patterns in mouse models. MCH treatment did not extend the survival of Sod1G86R mice but did decrease the loss of lumbar motor neurons. These findings suggest MCH and orexin signaling as potential targets to treat sleep alterations that arise in early stages of the disease."

    "abstract": "Plants sense and respond to hyperosmotic stress via quick activation of sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2). Under unstressed conditions, the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) in clade A interact with and inhibit SnRK2s in subgroup III, which are released from the PP2C inhibition via pyrabactin resistance 1-like (PYL) abscisic acid receptors. However, how SnRK2s are released under osmotic stress is unclear. Here, we outline how subgroup I SnRK2s sense molecular crowding to interrupt PP2C-mediated inhibition in plants. Severe hyperosmotic stress triggers condensate formation to activate the subgroup I SnRK2s, which requires their intrinsically disordered region. PP2Cs interact with and inhibit subgroup I SnRK2s, and this interaction is disrupted by phase separation of SnRK2s. The subgroup I SnRK2s are critical for severe osmotic stress responses. Our findings elucidate a mechanism for how macromolecular crowding is sensed in plants and demonstrate that physical separation of signaling molecules can segregate negative regulators to initiate signaling."

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma bradyzoites reside in tissue cysts that undergo cycles of expansion, rupture, and release to foster chronic infection. The glycosylated cyst wall acts as a protective barrier, although the processes responsible for formation, remodeling, and turnover are not understood. Herein, we identify a noncanonical chitinase-like enzyme TgCLP1 that localizes to micronemes and is targeted to the cyst wall after secretion. Genetic deletion of TgCLP1 resulted in a thickened cyst wall that decreased cyst turnover, blocked the export of virulence effectors into host cells, and resulted in failure to persist during chronic infection. Genetic complementation with a series of mutants revealed that the GH19 glycosidase domain was crucial for regulating glycosylation of several glycoproteins in the cyst wall. Overall, our findings reveal that TgCLP1 is a multifunctional survival factor that modifies glycoproteins within the cyst wall to modulate export of virulence effectors and regulate turnover of tissue cysts."

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally. While immunotherapeutic approaches are effective in a subset of CRC patients, the majority of CRC cases receive limited benefits from immunotherapy. This study developed an immune subtype classification system based on diverse immune cells and pathways. A model constructed through machine learning based on immune subtypes could accurately predict the sensitivity of CRC patients to immunotherapy. Validation of this model across public datasets and clinical samples confirmed its high precision and reliability. Furthermore, drug screening based on the immune subtypes identified the IGF1R inhibitor I-OMe-AG-538 (AG-538) as a potent enhancer of antitumor immunity. Mechanistic investigations revealed that AG-538 induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent DNA damage and downregulated the expression of multiple repair genes, triggering cGAS/STING-mediated type I IFN signaling within tumor cells. This signaling cascade increased tumor immunogenicity and refined the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby enhancing efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade treatment. In summary, these findings present a predictive model for immune response and highlight the potential of AG-538 combined with anti-PD1 antibodies as a chemoimmunotherapeutic strategy."

However, these studies have predominantly included older, non-Black women, and the related socioeconomic status (SES) data is limited. Increased representation and depth of social data are crucial for understanding how health inequity is intertwined with somatic landscapes. Here, we conducted targeted sequencing on primary tumors from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (N = 357; 52% Black, 47% <50) and compared the results to The Cancer Genome Atlas (N = 948; 18% Black, 27% <50). Race (Black vs. non-Black), age, and SES were evaluated in association with mutations, copy number alterations, and aneuploidy using generalized linear models. Pathway dysfunction was also assessed by aggregating mutation and copy number alterations. Adjusting for age, Black participants (N =350) were significantly more likely to have TP53 and FAT1 mutations and less likely to have PIK3CA, CDH1, DDR2, and GATA3 mutations than non-Black participants. Younger participants had more GATA3 alterations and fewer KMT2C, PTEN, MAP3K1 and CDH1 alterations. Black participants had significant enrichment for MYC (8q) and PIK3CA (3q26) amplifications and higher total aneuploidy, but age was not associated with copy number variation. SES was associated with different patterns of alteration in Black versus non-Black women. Overall, Black participants showed modest differences in TP53, PIK3CA, and other alterations that further varied by SES. Race is a social construct, and varying distributions of etiologic factors across social strata may predispose Black, young, and low SES women to cancer subtypes characterized by these alterations."

Complication rates were associated with obesity in 3 of 10 studies. Obesity was modestly associated with dehiscence and readmission for flap reconstruction, debridement, and skin-grafting techniques in one study, dehiscence in a second, and delayed wound healing in another. One of 5 studies that reported complication rates in patients with diabetes found increased hospital readmissions for debridement (deroofing or excision without flap/graft) and flap reconstruction. No studies evaluating smoking found increased associated risks.\nConclusions and relevance: This review highlights a greater need for consistent analysis and reporting of the surgical outcomes among patients with HS and certain comorbidities. Further rigorous clinical trials are needed to validate these findings and improve access to surgery in this patient population."

Data were extracted between October 2023 and January 2024 and analyzed between February 2024 and June 2024.\nExposures: Genetically estimated sensitivity to environmental stress and adversity.\nMain outcomes and measures: The main outcome was lung cancer risk, and odds ratios and 95% CIs were used to assess the association between sensitivity to environmental stress and adversity with lung cancer risk. This genetic association study used a 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the association between genetically estimated sensitivity to environmental stress and adversity and lung cancer risk across different histologic types.\nResults: Using data from 351 827 individuals from the UK Biobank and a cross-ancestry genome-wide analysis of 61 047 lung cancer cases and 947 237 controls from the International Lung Cancer Consortium, sensitivity to environmental stress and adversity was significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among individuals of European ancestry (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.13-1.98; P = .005) and in the cross-ancestry analysis (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.13-1.85; P = .004).

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), including liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide, have demonstrated efficacy for weight loss in clinical trials. The paradigm shift in the approach to obesity management drugs (OMDs) may offer an opportunity to examine online search activity and prescription trends.\nObjective: To investigate prescription patterns and online search trends for OMD and correlating usage dynamics with public engagement regarding these medications.\nDesign, setting, and participants: This repeated cross-sectional study analyzed online searches and corresponding data for dispensed prescriptions derived from the IQVIA National Prescription Audit, a comprehensive audit capturing approximately 90% of US retail prescription dispensing that is then projected to population-level data. Data from online searches and on prescriptions from the National Prescription Audit for US Food and Drug Administration-approved OMDs were collected from July 1, 2017, through February 29, 2024. This population-level analysis included all eligible individuals using either the Google search engine or receiving prescriptions.\nExposures: US monthly query fractions as online searches per 10 million total searches and monthly prescriptions dispensed for OMDs.\nMain outcome and measures: Trends in OMD prescriptions and online searches were visually analyzed, and quantitative correlations were calculated using Spearman rank correlation.\nResults: During the study period, 69 213 936 prescriptions for OMDs were dispensed in the US, with an overall increase of 0.76 to 0.80 million from July 2017 to June 2018 and 1.29 to 1.51 million from March 2023 to February 2024 and a mean (SD) annual growth rate of 5.3% (9.4%). Total monthly OMD prescriptions reached 1.5 million in February 2024, accounting for 0.41% of all prescriptions that month. Phentermine, semaglutide (Wegovy; Novo Nordisk), liraglutide (Saxenda; Novo Nordisk), and tirzepatide (Zepbound; Eli Lilly) were most prescribed. By February 2024, phentermine had approximately 0.74 million monthly prescriptions, Wegovy had 0.42 million, and Zepbound had 0.25 million. Most prescriptions were issued by advanced practice practitioners (APP) and primary care physicians (PCPs) and internists. The APPs' share increased from 25.3% in July 2017 to 40.6% in February 2024, while PCPs' and internists' share decreased from 57.9% to 48.1%. Wegovy's share of total OMDs increased to 27.7% and 28.3% and Zepbound's share to 16.1% and 16.5% (both February 2024) among APPs and PCPs and internists, respectively. Phentermine's dropped from 86.3% and 85.1% (July 2017) to 50.8% and 49.7% (February 2024), respectively. Online searches per 10 million reflected prescription trends, with Wegovy at 636.3, Zepbound at 468.9, and phentermine at 301.8 (all February 2024). The strongest correlations between prescriptions and search volumes were observed for semaglutide (Wegovy; r = 0.97) and tirzepatide (Zepbound; r = 0.90).\nConclusions and relevance: This repeated cross-sectional study shows the dynamic growth and evolving share of new obesity medications since 2017 and a significant shift toward semaglutide and tirzepatide prescribing. The joint surge in prescriptions and online searches and their close correlation highlight the real-time associations between public awareness and prescription trends."

    "abstract": "Importance: The effectiveness of different approaches to dementia care is unknown.\nObjective: To determine the effectiveness of health system-based, community-based dementia care, and usual care for persons with dementia and for caregiver outcomes.\nDesign, setting, and participants: Randomized clinical trial of community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers conducted at 4 sites in the US (enrollment June 2019-January 2023; final follow-up, August 2023).\nInterventions: Participants were randomized 7:7:1 to health system-based care provided by an advanced practice dementia care specialist (n = 1016); community-based care provided by a social worker, nurse, or licensed therapist care consultant (n = 1016); or usual care (n = 144).\nMain outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes were caregiver-reported Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) severity score for persons living with dementia (range, 0-36; higher scores, greater behavioral symptoms severity; minimal clinically important difference [MCID], 2.8-3.2) and Modified Caregiver Strain Index for caregivers (range, 0-26; higher scores, greater strain; MCID, 1.5-2.3). Three secondary outcomes included caregiver self-efficacy (range, 4-20; higher scores, more self-efficacy).\nResults: Among 2176 dyads (individuals with dementia, mean age, 80.6 years; 58.4%, female; and 20.6%, Black or Hispanic; caregivers, mean age, 65.2 years; 75.8%, female; and 20.8% Black or Hispanic), primary outcomes were assessed for more than 99% of participants, and 1343 participants (62% of those enrolled and 91% still alive and had not withdrawn) completed the study through 18 months. No significant differences existed between the 2 treatments or between treatments vs usual care for the primary outcomes. Overall, the least squares means (LSMs) for NPI-Q scores were 9.8 for health system, 9.5 for community-based, and 10.1 for usual care. The difference between health system vs community-based care was 0.30 (97.5% CI, -0.18 to 0.78); health system vs usual care, -0.33 (97.5% CI, -1.32 to 0.67); and community-based vs usual care, -0.62 (97.5% CI, -1.61 to 0.37). The LSMs for the Modified Caregiver Strain Index were 10.7 for health system, 10.5 for community-based, and 10.6 for usual care. The difference between health system vs community-based care was 0.25 (97.5% CI, -0.16 to 0.66); health system vs usual care, 0.14 (97.5% CI, -0.70 to 0.99); and community-based vs usual care, -0.10 (97.5% CI, -0.94 to 0.74). Only the secondary outcome of caregiver self-efficacy was significantly higher for both treatments vs usual care but not between treatments: LSMs were 15.1 for health system, 15.2 for community-based, and 14.4 for usual care. The difference between health system vs community-based care was -0.16 (95% CI, -0.37 to 0.06); health system vs usual care, 0.70 (95% CI, 0.26-1.14); and community-based vs usual care, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.29).\nConclusions and relevance: In this randomized trial of dementia care programs, no significant differences existed between health system-based and community-based care interventions nor between either active intervention or usual care regarding patient behavioral symptoms and caregiver strain.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03786471."

    "heading": "Causal associations between immune cells and psychiatric disorders: a bidirectional mendelian randomization analysis",
    "abstract": "Extensive researches illuminate a potential interplay between immune traits and psychiatric disorders. However, whether there is the causal relationship between the two remains an unresolved question. We conducted a two-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization by utilizing summary data of 731 immune cell traits from genome-wide association studies (GCST90001391-GCST90002121)) and 11 psychiatric disorders including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BIP), anorexia nervosa (AN), major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette syndrome (TS), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and substance use disorders (cannabis) (SUD) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). A total of four types of immune signatures (median fluorescence intensities [MFI], relative cell [RC], absolute cell [AC], and morphological parameters [MP]) were included. Effect estimates were obtained by using the inverse-variance-weighted (IVW), weighted median method, Mendelian randomization (MR)-Egger, and corrected by false discovery rate. Outliers were evaluated through the leave-one-out technique. Horizontal pleiotropy was assessed using the MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) and MR-Egger intercept tests. MR analysis results suggested several immune cell subtypes were casually associated with psychiatric disorders. It was found that CD33br HLA DR + CD14 - AC (Myeloid cell, AC) may contribute to decreasing the risk of BIP (odds ratio [OR] = 0.9179, confidence interval [CI] = 0.8829-0.9542, PFDR = 7.06 × 10-3), and likewise, CD38 on transitional (B cell, MFI) also showed negative causal effect on SCZ risk (OR = 0.9551, CI = 0.9330-0.9776, PFDR = 0.0441). While IgD - CD27 - %lymphocyte (B cell, RC) has causal effect on increasing BIP risk (OR = 1.0184, CI = 1.0079-1.0291, PFDR = 0.0201). In addition, HLA DR + + monocyte %monocyte (TBNK, RC) is likely to increase AN onset (OR = 1.0746, CI = 1.0324-1.1186, PFDR = 0.0506), and CCR2 on CD14 - CD16 + monocyte (Monocyte, MFI) may contribute to PTSD (OR = 1.0591, CI = 1.0275-1.0917, PFDR = 0.0369). Sensitivity analysis revealed consistency of results. Our research elucidates there may be causal links between immune traits and the onset of psychiatric disorders, which established a groundwork for the prospective clinical utilization of immune cells as markers for the diagnosis and early intervention of psychiatric disorders."

    "abstract": "Background: This study aimed to investigate the effects of oral semaglutide on the changes in food preference of Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.\nMethods: This retrospective multicenter study included 75 patients with type 2 diabetes who received oral semaglutide. The primary outcome was the change in the score of brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire (BDHQ) score 3 months after the initiation of oral semaglutide treatment. The secondary outcome was the change in the Control of Eating Questionnaire (CoEQ), HbA1c, and body mass index (BMI) after 3 months.\nResults: The median age, BMI, and HbA1c of the 23 participants were 64.0 years, 26.9 kg/m2, and 7.6% (59 mmol/mol). The BDHQ results showed total energy was significantly reduced. Among the individual nutrients, carbohydrates most decreased. The CoEQ results particularly showed declines in cravings for something sweet, chocolate or chocolate flavored foods, and starchy foods, satisfaction at meals, frequency and intensity of food craving, difficulty of resisting the craving for food, and frequency of eating in response to cravings for food were significantly lower after 3 months. The mean HbA1c and BMI significantly decreased.\nConclusions: In Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide treatment decreased total energy intake and changed food preferences."

    "heading": "Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation",
    "abstract": "Background: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are handheld electronic vaping devices that produce an aerosol by heating an e-liquid. People who smoke, healthcare providers, and regulators want to know if ECs can help people quit smoking, and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This is a review update conducted as part of a living systematic review.\nObjectives: To examine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of using EC to help people who smoke tobacco achieve long-term smoking abstinence, in comparison to non-nicotine EC, other smoking cessation treatments, and no treatment.\nSearch methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 February 2024 and the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register to 1 February 2023, reference-checked, and contacted study authors.\nSelection criteria: We included trials randomizing people who smoke to an EC or control condition. We included uncontrolled intervention studies in which all participants received an EC intervention. Studies had to report an eligible outcome.\nData collection and analysis: We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. We used the risk of bias tool (RoB 1) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Critical outcomes were abstinence from smoking after at least six months, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Important outcomes were biomarkers, toxicants/carcinogens, and longer-term EC use. We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences. Where appropriate, we pooled data in pairwise and network meta-analyses (NMA).\nMain results: We included 90 completed studies (two new to this update), representing 29,044 participants, of which 49 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of the included studies, we rated 10 (all but one contributing to our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 61 at high risk overall (including all non-randomized studies), and the remainder at unclear risk. Nicotine EC results in increased quit rates compared to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (high-certainty evidence) (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.93; I2 = 0%; 7 studies, 2544 participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional four quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 6 more). The rate of occurrence of AEs is probably similar between groups (moderate-certainty evidence (limited by imprecision)) (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.17; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 2052 participants). SAEs were rare, and there is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates differ between groups due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.60; I2 = 32%; 6 studies, 2761 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nicotine EC probably results in increased quit rates compared to non-nicotine EC (moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision) (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.96; I2 = 4%; 6 studies, 1613 participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 1 to 7 more). There is probably little to no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (moderate-certainty evidence) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 840 participants). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differ between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.79; I2 = 0%; 9 studies, 1412 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to behavioural support only/no support, quit rates may be higher for participants randomized to nicotine EC (low-certainty evidence due to issues with risk of bias) (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.32; I2 = 0%; 11 studies, 6819 participants). In absolute terms, this represents an additional four quitters per 100 (95% CI 3 to 5 more). There was some evidence that (non-serious) AEs may be more common in people randomized to nicotine EC (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.27; I2 = 6%; low-certainty evidence; 6 studies, 2351 participants) and, again, insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28; I2 = 0%; 12 studies, 4561 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Results from the NMA were consistent with those from pairwise meta-analyses for all critical outcomes. There was inconsistency in the AE network, which was explained by a single outlying study contributing the only direct evidence for one of the nodes. Data from non-randomized studies were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued EC use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons; hence, evidence for these is limited, with CIs often encompassing both clinically significant harm and benefit.\nAuthors' conclusions: There is high-certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine increase quit rates compared to NRT and moderate-certainty evidence that they increase quit rates compared to ECs without nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care or no treatment also suggests benefit, but is less certain due to risk of bias inherent in the study design. Confidence intervals were, for the most part, wide for data on AEs, SAEs, and other safety markers, with no evidence for a difference in AEs between nicotine and non-nicotine ECs nor between nicotine ECs and NRT, but low-certainty evidence for increased AEs compared with behavioural support/no support. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect evidence of serious harm from nicotine EC, but longer, larger studies are needed to fully evaluate EC safety. Our included studies tested regulated nicotine-containing EC; illicit products and/or products containing other active substances (e.g. tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) may have different harm profiles. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision due to the small number of RCTs, often with low event rates. Further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up-to-date information to decision-makers, this is a living systematic review. We run searches monthly, with the review updated when relevant new evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the review's current status."

    "abstract": "Artificial sweeteners have emerged as popular alternatives to traditional sweeteners, driven by the growing concern over sugar consumption and its associated rise in obesity and metabolic disorders. Despite their widespread use, the safety and health implications of artificial sweeteners remain a topic of debate, with conflicting evidence contributing to uncertainty about their long-term effects. This review synthesizes current scientific evidence regarding the impact of artificial sweeteners on gut microbiota and gastrointestinal health. Our analysis of in vitro experiments, animal models, and clinical trials reveals that artificial sweeteners can alter the composition and abundance of gut microbes. These changes raise concerns about their potential to affect overall gut health and contribute to gastrointestinal disorders. Additionally, artificial sweeteners have been shown to influence the production of metabolites by gut bacteria, further impacting systemic health. The findings suggest that artificial sweeteners may have complex and sometimes contradictory effects on gut microbiota. While some studies indicate potential benefits, such as reduced caloric intake and weight management, others highlight detrimental effects on microbial balance and metabolic functions. The inconsistent results underscore the need for further research to comprehensively understand the physiological impacts of various artificial sweeteners on human health. Future studies should aim for long-term, well-controlled investigations to clarify these relationships, ensuring evidence-based guidelines for the safe use of artificial sweeteners in diet management. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry."

    "abstract": "Objective: To identify strategies to prevent and treat delayed gastric emptying (DGE) after pancreatic surgery.\nBackground: Among all complications of pancreatic surgery, DGE has the largest impact on prolonged hospital stay. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have addressed DGE after pancreatic surgery, either as primary or as secondary outcome.\nMethods: RCTs involving pancreatic surgery with DGE as primary or secondary outcome were identified using the online database of the ISGPS Evidence Map of Pancreatic Surgery (2007-2023). Meta-analysis was performed for impact on DGE grade B/C for interventions studied by at least 2 RCTs.\nResults: Overall, 152 RCTs were included with 22,260 patients undergoing pancreatic surgery. The overall rate of DGE grade B/C was 11.9%, including 12.7% after pancreatoduodenectomy and 4.2% after left pancreatectomy. No RCT identified an effective treatment of DGE grade B/C. Strategies which reduced the rate of DGE in at least one RCT included: prehabilitation, pancreatico-jejunostomy, antecolic gastrojejunostomy, Billroth II technique, pylorus resection, modified Roux-en-Y technique, no intraperitoneal drainage in left pancreatectomy, minimally invasive left pancreatectomy, minimally invasive pancreatoduodenectomy, mERAS, nasojejunal tube, and early oral feeding. Additional meta-analyses identified minimally-invasive left pancreatectomy as preventive for DGE grade B/C compared to open left pancreatectomy.\nConclusion: This systematic review of RCTs identified 12 strategies which reduced the rate of DGE grade B/C after pancreatic surgery but no effective treatment strategy. Of the 12 preventive strategies, only minimally-invasive left pancreatectomy was confirmed effective in a meta-analysis. Future RCTs should focus on both prevention and treatment of DGE after pancreatic surgery."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have shown promise in reducing amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels in neurons, but their effects in astrocytes, key contributors to neurodegenerative diseases, remain unclear. This study evaluates the efficacy of APP ASOs in astrocytes derived from an individual with Down syndrome (DS), a population at high risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nMethods: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from a healthy individual and an individual with DS were differentiated into astrocytes. Astrocytes were treated with APP ASOs for 10 days, and APP levels were quantified. Mitochondrial morphology and superoxide production in DS astrocytes were analyzed using super-resolution and confocal microscopy.\nResults: APP ASOs significantly reduced APP levels in astrocytes from both control and DS individuals. In DS astrocytes, treatment restored mitochondrial health, increasing mitochondrial number and size while reducing superoxide production.\nDiscussion: APP ASOs effectively reduce APP levels and improve mitochondrial health in astrocytes, suggesting their potential as a therapeutic approach for DS and DS-related AD. Further in vivo studies are required to confirm these findings.\nHighlights: APP ASOs reduce APP levels in human iPSC-derived astrocytes. APP ASO treatment rescues mitochondrial phenotypes in trisomy 21 astrocytes. This study supports ASOs as a potential therapy for Down syndrome-related Alzheimer's disease."

The first identified causative variant was in the gene encoding the desmosomal protein plakoglobin. Naxos disease exhibits fibro-fatty myocardial replacement with immunohistological abnormalities in cardiac protein and signaling pathways, highlighting the role of inflammation and potential anti-inflammatory treatments. Childhood cutaneous signs precede cardiac features, which are diagnosed by familial and genetic evaluation, electrocardiography and cardiac imaging. Disease progression necessitates holistic care with risk management and lifestyle adjustments, often needing treatment for arrhythmia and heart failure. Similar phenotypes have been linked to desmoplakin and rarely desmocollin2 gene variants, highlighting the importance of familial and genetic evaluation.

    "abstract": "Background & aims: Atezolizumab/bevacizumab (A/B) is now a standard first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the optimal second-line regimen is not known. We evaluated real-world treatment patterns and outcomes to investigate factors associated with post-progression survival (PPS).\nMethods: In this multicenter, international, retrospective study, we examined clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with advanced HCC who progressed on first-line A/B. The primary outcome of PPS was defined as time from first radiographic progression on A/B to death.\nResults: A total of 406 patients alive after progression on first-line A/B were included in the final analysis, of whom 45.3% (n = 184) received best supportive treatment (BST) and 54.7% (n = 222) continued active systemic treatment. In the second line, 155 patients were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), 45 with immune checkpoint inhibitor (IO)-based regimens, and 3 had missing data. Median PPS of the whole cohort (mPPS) was 6.0 months (95% CI 5.2-7.2). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, absence of portal vein tumor thrombus, ECOG <2, and continued active treatment were predictors of better PPS. mPPS was significantly longer for patients who continued active treatment vs. BST (9.7 vs. 2.6 months; HR 0.41, p <0.001). In the second-line setting, patients treated with TKIs had a numerically shorter mPPS compared to those treated with IO (8.4 vs. 14.9 months; HR 1.37, p = 0.256).\nConclusions: Continuation of active therapy after A/B progression was independently associated with better survival even after adjusting for baseline disease characteristics. mPPS with IO-based therapy exceeded a year, suggesting that IO continuation post-progression may retain benefit. The precise sequencing of TKI and IO regimens warrants further investigation.\nImpact and implications: There is currently a lack of level 1 data on second-line treatment options for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who progress after frontline atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, as all second-line approvals were established during the frontline sorafenib era. Our study aims to fill in some of the knowledge gap by investigating real-world patient outcomes in the second-line treatment setting. Findings from this study show that patients who continued active treatment had improved post-progression survival compared to those who received best supportive care, and medication regimens incorporating tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as immunotherapy agents were active. These results can help inform clinicians of possible treatment options for patients who progress after frontline atezolizumab plus bevacizumab while we await maturing data from randomized-controlled trials."

We conducted a phase 2 trial to determine the efficacy of durvalumab, tremelimumab, and platinum-pemetrexed in EGFR-mutant NSCLC after progression with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).\nMethods: Participants were treated with induction durvalumab, tremelimumab, and platinum-pemetrexed, followed by durvalumab-pemetrexed maintenance. Participants were divided into two cohorts: (1) EGFR exon 20 T790M negative (T790M-, progressing on either first-line osimertinib, or on a single line of first/second generation TKI), and (2) T790M positive (T790M+, progressing on greater than or equal to 1 lines of TKI, including osimertinib). The primary endpoint was the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) assessed by the investigators. Progression-free survival and safety were secondary outcomes.\nResults: One hundred participants from Australia and Taiwan were enrolled. Median follow-up was 26 months with 88% and 96% experiencing progression events for T790M- and T790M+, respectively. The ORR for T790M- was 31% (95% confidence interval: 20-45), including two complete responses. The ORR for T790M+ was 21% (95% confidence interval: 12-34). Median durations of response were 9.5 months and 6.3 months for T790M- and T790M+, respectively; median progression-free survival rates were 6.5 months and 4.9 months, respectively. For T790M-, ORR was 27% for 50% or higher PD-L1 (n = 22) and 0% for less than 50% PD-L1 (n = 10), respectively. For T790M+, ORR was 17% for 50% or higher PD-L1 (n = 24). The safety profile was consistent with previous reports.\nConclusions: Durvalumab, tremelimumab, and platinum-pemetrexed had modest anti-tumor activity in EGFR-mutant NSCLC after progression on TKI. The T790M- cohort had higher ORR and a longer duration of response. Immune adverse events were not increased with tremelimumab. The clinical registration number of this trial is NCT03994393."

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by motor neuron damage leading to death from respiratory failure. The neurodegenerative process in ALS is characterized by an accumulation of aberrant proteins (TDP-43, SOD1, etc.) in CNS cells. The trans-synaptic transmission of these proteins via exosomes may be one of the mechanisms through which the pathology progresses. The aim of this work was to study the effect of an intraventricular injection of exosomes obtained from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ALS patients on the motor activity and CNS pathomorphology of mice. The exosomes were obtained from two ALS patients and a healthy donor. Exosome suspensions at high and low concentrations were injected into the lateral brain ventricles of male BALB/c mice (n = 45). Motor activity and physiological parameters were evaluated twice a month; morphological examination of the spinal cord was performed 14 months after the start of the experiment. Nine months after administration of exosomes from the ALS patients, the animals started exhibiting a pathological motor phenotype; i.e., altered locomotion with paresis of hind limbs, coordination impairment, and increasing episodes of immobility. The motor symptoms accelerated after administration of a higher concentration of exosomes. The experimental group showed a significant decrease in motor neuron density in the ventral horns of the spinal cord, a significant increase in the number of microglial cells, and microglia activation. The TDP43 protein in the control animals was localized in the nuclei of motor neurons. TDP43 mislocation with its accumulation in the cytoplasm was observed in the experimental group. Thus, the triggering effect of the exosomal proteins derived from the CSF of ALS patients in the development of a motor neuron pathology in the experimental animals was established. This confirms the pathogenetic role of exosomes in neurodegenerative progression and makes it possible to identify a new target for ALS therapy."

The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data on its efficacy against depression and suicidality as well as its side effects.\nMethods: MEDLINE was searched with the keyword \"esketamine\" on March 24, 2024, using the PRISMA method. Data processing and statistical analysis were performed with R, version 4.3.3, and the meta-analysis was performed with the METAFOR package.\nResults: Of 1,115 articles initially identified, 87 were included for analysis and discussion. At weeks 2-4, randomized controlled trials were mostly negative or failed; however, the meta-analysis returned a weak but significant positive effect for depression (effect size range, 0.15-0.23 at weeks 2-4), similar to augmentation strategies with atypical antipsychotics for treatment-resistant depression. The effect size concerning suicidality was not significant at any time point. The sensitivity analysis produced the same results.\nConclusions: The study findings suggest that esketamine's efficacy as an add-on to antidepressants is modest in treatment-resistant depression (similar to augmentation strategies with atypical antipsychotics) and is absent against suicidality itself. These findings need to be considered in light of esketamine's abuse potential and the fact that long-term effects are still not fully known. Some alarming signs concerning deaths and emerging suicidality during the testing phase are discussed, along with other regulatory issues."

A diffuse (11% to 100%) and clustered pattern of SALL4 immunostaining in cytotrophoblast/intermediate trophoblast was statistically associated with choriocarcinomas (74.2%, 23/31) as compared with PSN (0/10; P<0.0001), APSN (0/8; P=0.0002), PSTT (0/9; P<0.0001), ETT (0/5; P=0.0034), PHM (0/13; P<0.0001), CHM/IM (0/47; P<0.0001), and nonmolar POC (0/26; P<0.0001). Most nonchoriocarcinoma samples showed no SALL4 expression; when present, it was of low level (1% to 10%) and with a scattered single-cell staining in 3/9 PSTT (33%), 1/13 PHM (7.7%), 19/47 CHM/IM (40%), and 1/26 nonmolar POC (1.7%). These results were confirmed using a validation cohort. In addition, 66% (31/47) of CHM/IM villous stromal fibroblasts showed SALL4 expression (11% to 100%) (all before 14 gestational weeks), whereas this level of expression was never observed in PHM (0/13), nor in nonmolar POC (0/26; P<0.0001). Finally, a clustered and >10% SALL4 immunostaining in cytotrophoblast/intermediate trophoblast favors choriocarcinoma diagnosis. SALL4 expression in >10% villous stromal fibroblasts before 14 gestational weeks favors CHM/IM rather than PHM and nonmolar POC."

    "abstract": "Tarlatamab is a bispecific T-cell engager immunotherapy targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) and the cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) molecule. In the phase 2 DeLLphi-301 trial of tarlatamab for patients with previously treated small cell lung cancer, tarlatamab 10 mg every 2 weeks achieved durable responses and encouraging survival outcomes. Analyses of updated safety data from the DeLLphi-301 trial demonstrated that the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (53%), pyrexia (38%), decreased appetite (36%), dysgeusia (32%), and an emia (30%). Cytokine release syndrome was mostly grade 1 or 2 in severity, occurred primarily after the first or second tarlatamab dose, and was managed with supportive care, which included the administration of antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen), intravenous hydration, and/or glucocorticoids. Other treatment-emergent adverse effects of interest included neutropenia (16%) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome and associated neurologic events (10%). Given that tarlatamab is the first T-cell engager approved for the treatment of small cell lung cancer, raising awareness with regard to the monitoring and management of tarlatamab-associated adverse events is essential. Here, the authors describe the timing, occurrence, and duration of these adverse events and review the management and risk-mitigation strategies used by clinical investigators during the DeLLphi-301 trial."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that is marked by profound neurovascular dysfunction and significant cell-specific alterations in the brain vasculature. Recent advances in high throughput single-cell transcriptomics technology have enabled the study of the human brain vasculature at an unprecedented depth. Additionally, the understudied niche of cerebrovascular cells, such as endothelial and mural cells, and their subtypes have been scrutinized for understanding cellular and transcriptional heterogeneity in AD. Here, we provide an overview of rich transcriptional signatures derived from recent single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomic studies of human brain vascular cells and their implications for targeted therapy for AD. We conducted an in-depth literature search using Medline and Covidence to identify pertinent AD studies that utilized single-cell technologies in human post-mortem brain tissue by focusing on understanding the transcriptional differences in cerebrovascular cell types and subtypes in AD and cognitively normal older adults. We also discuss impaired cellular crosstalk between vascular cells and neuroglial units, as well as astrocytes in AD. Additionally, we contextualize the findings from single-cell studies of distinct endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and pericytes in the human AD brain and highlight pathways for potential therapeutic interventions as a concerted multi-omic effort with spatial transcriptomics technology, neuroimaging, and neuropathology. Overall, we provide a detailed account of the vascular cell-specific transcriptional signatures in AD and their crucial cellular crosstalk with the neuroglial unit."

    "abstract": "Background: Immune cells within tumor tissues play important roles in remodeling the tumor microenvironment, thus affecting tumor progression and the therapeutic response. The current study was designed to identify key markers of plasma cells and explore their role in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).\nMethods: We utilized single-cell sequencing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify key immune cell types within HGSOC tissues and to extract related markers via the Seurat package. The effects of immune cell markers on prognosis were analyzed via univariate Cox regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) of bulk sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-HGSOC cohort. Finally, the effects of key markers on HGSOC cells were evaluated via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), Transwell, colony formation, wound healing, immunofluorescence and in vivo tumor growth assays.\nResults: At the single-cell level, we detected a significant increase in the proportion of plasma cells in HGSOC samples compared to that in normal ovarian samples. Within HGSOC tissues, these plasma cells were found to interact with CD8 + T cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In addition, patients in the high-plasma cell-related score group had better survival rates and higher epithelial‒mesenchymal transition (EMT), apoptosis and immune scores. Moreover, univariate Cox and LASSO regression analyses revealed that ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 J1 (UBE2J1) is a prognostic marker in HGSOC. Further functional studies revealed that overexpression of UBE2J1 promoted cell proliferation, invasion, migration and colony formation, whereas UBE2J1 knockdown attenuated the abovementioned cellular behaviors. Additionally, UBE2J1 overexpression promoted EMT, as evidenced by alterations in the protein expression levels of N-cadherin, snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (Slug), Twist family BHLH transcription factor 1 (Twist 1) and E-cadherin. Moreover, we found that UBE2J1 silencing was able to inhibit the tumor growth in vivo.\nConclusions: Overall, this study elucidated the role of plasma cells and revealed UBE2J1 as a novel oncogene in HGSOC, uncovering new mechanisms related to HGSOC tumorigenesis and promising therapeutic targets for HGSOC patients."

    "abstract": "Background: Adolescent diabetes is one of the major public health problems worldwide. This study aims to estimate the burden of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adolescents from 1990 to 2021, and to predict diabetes prevalence through 2030.\nMethods: We extracted epidemiologic data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) on T1DM and T2DM among adolescents aged 10-24 years in 204 countries and territories worldwide. This study calculated the age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) and age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) in adolescents based on the world standard population for cross-country comparisons. Average annual percentage changes (AAPC) in age-standardized rate were calculated by linkage point regression. Correlation analyses were used to identify the relationship between age-standardized rate and sociodemographic index (SDI). The Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model was used to predict changes in the diabetes prevalence among adolescents from 2022 to 2030.\nResults: In 2021, 3.4 million adolescents were living with T1DM, with an ASPR of 180.96 (95% CI 180.77-181.15), and 14.6 million were living with T2DM, with ASPR of 1190.73 (1190.13-1191.34). As national and territory SDI levels rise, the prevalence rate of T1DM increases (r = 0.44, p < 0.01), and the prevalence rate of T2DM decreases (r = - 0.18, p < 0.01). Compared with males, females had a greater age-standardized prevalence of T1DM (185.49 [185.21-185.76] vs. 176.66 [176.39-176.92]), whereas males had a greater ASPR of T2DM than females did (1241.45 [1240.58-1242.31] vs. 1138.24 [1137.40-1139.09]). This study found a negative correlation between the SDI and the ASDR for both T1DM (r = - 0.51, p < 0.01) and T2DM (r = - 0.62, p < 0.01) in adolescents. For T2DM patients, 32.84% of DALYs were attributed to high BMI, which increased by 40.78% during the study period. By 2030, 3.7 million people are projected to have T1DM, and 14.6 million are projected to have T2DM.\nConclusions: Among adolescents, the burden of T1DM and T2DM is increasing and varies by region, sex, and SDI. Therefore, targeted interventions based on regional features are needed to prevent and control adolescent diabetes. Moreover, more efforts are needed to control climate change and obesity to reduce the adolescent diabetes burden."

    "heading": "E. Coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 promotes colorectal carcinogenesis by causing oxidative stress, DNA damage and intestinal permeability alteration",
    "abstract": "Background: Bacterial toxins are emerging as promising hallmarks of colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis. In particular, Cytotoxic Necrotizing Factor 1 (CNF1) from E. coli deserves special consideration due to the significantly higher prevalence of this toxin gene in CRC patients with respect to healthy subjects, and to the numerous tumor-promoting effects that have been ascribed to the toxin in vitro. Despite this evidence, a definitive causal link between CNF1 and CRC was missing. Here we investigated whether CNF1 plays an active role in CRC onset by analyzing pro-carcinogenic key effects specifically induced by the toxin in vitro and in vivo.\nMethods: Viability assays, confocal microscopy of γH2AX and 53BP1 molecules and cytogenetic analysis were carried out to assess CNF1-induced genotoxicity on non-neoplastic intestinal epithelial cells. Caco-2 monolayers and 3D Caco-2 spheroids were used to evaluate permeability alterations specifically induced by CNF1, either in the presence or in the absence of inflammation. In vivo, an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) model was exploited to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of CNF1. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence stainings of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) colon tissue were carried out as well as fecal microbiota composition analysis by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing.\nResults: CNF1 induces the release of reactive oxidizing species and chromosomal instability in non-neoplastic intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, CNF1 modifies intestinal permeability by directly altering tight junctions' distribution in 2D Caco-2 monolayers, and by hindering the differentiation of 3D Caco-2 spheroids with an irregular arrangement of these junctions. In vivo, repeated intrarectal administration of CNF1 induces the formation of dysplastic aberrant crypt foci (ACF), and produces the formation of colorectal adenomas in an IBD model. These effects are accompanied by the increased neutrophilic infiltration in colonic tissue, by a mixed pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu, and by the pro-tumoral modulation of the fecal microbiota.\nConclusions: Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that the CNF1 toxin from E. coli plays an active role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Altogether, these findings not only add new knowledge to the contribution of bacterial toxins to CRC, but also pave the way to the implementation of current screening programs and preventive strategies."

    "abstract": "Background: The retinal degenerative diseases retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and atrophic age- related macular degeneration (AMD) are characterized by vision loss from photoreceptor (PR) degeneration. Unfortunately, current treatments for these diseases are limited at best. Genetic and other preclinical evidence suggest a relationship between retinal degeneration and inflammation. To further explore this relationship, we tested whether Ibuprofen (IBU), an FDA-approved non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), could promote PR survival and function in a mouse model of light damage (LD)-induced PR degeneration.\nMethods: LD was induced by exposing mice to 4000 lx of light for 2-4 hours (h). IBU (100 or 200 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered by daily intraperitoneal injection. Retinal structure and function were evaluated by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and electroretinography (ERG). Cell death genes were analyzed at 24 and 72 h after LD using the Mouse Pan-Cell Death Pathway PCR Array (88 genes). The cellular location and protein expression of key necroptosis genes were assessed by immunohistochemistry.\nResults: Retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness in vehicle-injected LD animals was 8.7 ± 0.6% of retinas without LD (p < 0.0001). In IBU 200 mg/kg treated mice, central ONL thickness was 74.9 ± 7.7% of untreated retinas (p < 0.001). A-wave and b-wave ERG amplitudes were significantly preserved in IBU-treated animals. IBU significantly inhibited retinal inflammation. Twenty-four hour after LD, retinal mRNA expression for the inflammatory-factors tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), interleukin-1 beta (Il1B), and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2) increased by 10-, 17-, and 533-fold, respectively; in IBU-treated animals, the expression levels of these inflammatory factors were not significantly different from no-LD controls. Expression of key necroptosis genes, including Ripk3 and Mlkl, were upregulated in LD vehicle-treated mice, but dramatically reduced to near no LD levels in LD IBU-treated mice. Microglia activation and MLKL protein upregulation were observed primarily in photoreceptors 12 h after LD, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. IBU reduced the upregulation of MLKL protein and microglia migration in the ONL and outer plexiform layer (OPL) of treated retinas.\nConclusions: Systemic administration of the anti-inflammatory drug IBU partially protected mouse retinas from light-induced photochemical damage and inhibited both inflammation and the necroptosis cell death pathways. Our results suggest that NSAIDs may provide a promising therapeutic approach for treatment of the human retinal degenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Background: The metabolic score for visceral fat (METS-VF) is a recently identified index for evaluating visceral fat, also referred to as abdominal obesity. The skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) serves as a critical measure for assessing muscle mass and sarcopenia. Both obesity and the reduction of muscle mass can significantly affect human health. However, research exploring the relationship between METS-VF and SMI remains limited. This study aims to investigate whether a association exists between these two indices, and if so, to elucidate the nature of their interactions.\nMethods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the NHANES database, focusing on U.S. adults aged 20 years and older from 2013 to 2018. Controlling for relevant covariables, we primarily investigated the association between METS-VF and SMI values utilizing weighted multivariable linear regression models. Additionally, we assessed the diagnostic efficacy of METS-VF for sarcopenia.\nResults: A total of 3,594 participants were included in this study for analysis. The final adjusted model from the weighted multivariable linear regression indicated that METS-VF was negatively associated with SMI, with a coefficient of β = -0.13 (95% CI: -0.14, -0.12; P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses further demonstrated that this negative association was consistent across different populations. Notably, the negative association varied significantly between diabetic and nondiabetic population, as well as among populations classified by different BMI categories. Additionally, threshold effect analysis identified a significant inflection knot at 6.33. The characteristic curves of the subjects' work illustrated that, compared to other indicators, METS-VF exhibited excellent diagnostic efficacy for sarcopenia, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.825.\nConclusion: Our results indicate that METS-VF is negatively correlated with SMI among adults in the United States, suggesting that visceral obesity exerts a detrimental effect on muscle mass. Furthermore, METS-VF shows potential as a valuable indicator for assessing SMI and sarcopenia. These findings underscore the importance of considering lipid metabolism disorders in the context of muscle health and highlight the potential for developing prevention strategies for sarcopenia."

    "abstract": "Background: Tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly immune cell infiltration, programmed cell death (PCD) and stress, has increasingly become a focal point in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. Uncovering the intricate crosstalk between these factors can enhance our understanding of CRC, guide therapeutic strategies, and improve patient prognosis.\nMethods: We constructed an immune-related cell death and stress (ICDS) prognostic model utilizing machine learning methodologies. Furthermore, we performed enrichment analyses and deconvolution algorithms to elucidate the complex interactions between immune cell infiltration and the processes of PCD and stress within a substantial array of transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus data base (GEO) related to CRC. Single-cell sequencing and biochemical experiments were used to validate the interaction between the model genes and programmed cell death in tumor cells.\nResults: The ICDS prognostic model exhibited robust predictive performance in seven independent cohorts, revealing an inverse correlation between model scores and patient prognosis. Meanwhile, the ICDS index was positively correlated with clinical stage. Model analysis indicated that patient subgroups with low ICDS index exhibited heightened immune activation features and elevated activity in PCD and stress pathways. Single-cell analysis further revealed that macrophages were the central drivers of immune characteristics underlying prognostic differences within the ICDS prognostic model. Pseudotime analysis and cellular experiments indicated that the model gene GAL3ST4 promotes the transition of macrophages toward an M2 pro-tumor phenotype. Furthermore, cell communication analysis and experimental validation revealed that the cuproptosis in tumor cells suppress GAL3ST4 expression, thereby inhibiting M2-like macrophage polarization.\nConclusion: In summary, we constructed the ICDS prognostic model and uncovered the mechanism by which tumor cells downregulate GAL3ST4 expression via cuproptosis to inhibit M2-like macrophage polarization, providing new targets and biomarkers for CRC treatment and prognosis evaluation."

    "abstract": "Background: Previous studies found that it is promising to achieve the protective effects of dietary patterns on cardiovascular health through the modulation of gut microbiota. However, conflicting findings have been reported on how dietary patterns impact gut microbiota in individuals either established or at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our systematic review aimed to explore the effect of dietary patterns on gut microbiota composition and on risk factors for CVD in these populations.\nMethods: We systematically searched seven databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINHAL (EBSCO), Web of Science, CNKI (Chinese), and Wanfang (Chinese), covering literature from inception to October 2024. Studies were included if they focused on adults aged 18 years and older with CVD or at least two CVD risk factors, implemented dietary pattern interventions, and incorporated outcomes related to microbiome analysis. The risk of bias for included studies was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2) for randomized trials and the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) for non-randomized studies. Changes in the relative abundance of the gut microbiome were summarized at various taxonomic levels, including phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the mean difference in cardiometabolic parameters pre- and post-intervention.\nResults: Nineteen studies were identified, including 17 RCT and two self-controlled trails. Risk of bias across the studies was mixed but mainly identified as low and unclear. The most frequently reported increased taxa were Faecalibacterium (N = 8) with plant-rich diets, Bacteroides (N = 3) with restrictive diets, and Ruminococcaceae UCG 005 and Alistipes (N = 9) with the polyphenol-rich diets. The most frequently reported decreased taxa were Parabacteroides (N = 7) with plant-rich diets, Roseburia (N = 3) with restrictive diets, and Ruminococcus gauvreauii group (N = 6) with the polyphenol-rich diets. Plant-rich diets showed a significant decrease in total cholesterol (TC) with a mean difference of -6.77 (95% CI, -12.36 to -2.58; I2 = 84.7%), while restrictive diets showed a significant decrease in triglycerides (TG) of -22.12 (95% CI, -36.05 to -8.19; I2 = 98.4%).\nConclusions: Different dietary patterns showed distinct impacts on gut microbiota composition. Plant-rich diets promoted the proliferation of butyrate-producing bacteria, suggesting promising prospects for modulating gut microbiota and butyrate production through dietary interventions to enhance cardiovascular health. Further research is warranted to investigate the long-term effects of dietary patterns on clinical endpoints, such as CVD events or mortality.\nReview registration: Registration number: CRD42024507660."

    "abstract": "Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by protein aggregates mostly consisting of misfolded alpha-synuclein (αSyn). Progressive degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (mDANs) and nigrostriatal projections results in severe motor symptoms. While the preferential loss of mDANs has not been fully understood yet, the cell type-specific vulnerability has been linked to a unique intracellular milieu, influenced by dopamine metabolism, high demand for mitochondrial activity, and increased level of oxidative stress (OS). These factors have been shown to adversely impact αSyn aggregation. Reciprocally, αSyn aggregates, in particular oligomers, can impair mitochondrial functions and exacerbate OS. Recent drug-discovery studies have identified a series of small molecules, including NPT100-18A, which reduce αSyn oligomerization by preventing misfolding and dimerization. NPT100-18A and structurally similar compounds (such as NPT200-11/UCB0599, currently being assessed in clinical studies) point towards a promising new approach for disease-modification.\nMethods: Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived mDANs from PD patients with a monoallelic SNCA locus duplication and unaffected controls were treated with NPT100-18A. αSyn aggregation was evaluated biochemically and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed in living mDANs using fluorescent dyes. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were measured using a luminescence-based assay, and neuronal cell death was evaluated by immunocytochemistry.\nResults: Compared to controls, patient-derived mDANs exhibited higher cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS probe levels, reduced ATP-related signals, and increased activation of caspase-3, reflecting early neuronal cell death. NPT100-18A-treatment rescued cleaved caspase-3 levels to control levels and, importantly, attenuated mitochondrial oxidative stress probe levels in a compartment-specific manner and, at higher concentrations, increased ATP signals.\nConclusions: Our findings demonstrate that NPT100-18A limits neuronal degeneration in a human in vitro model of PD. In addition, we provide first mechanistic insights into how a compartment-specific antioxidant effect in mitochondria might contribute to the neuroprotective effects of NPT100-18A."

    "abstract": "Depression is one of the most disabling mental disorders worldwide and characterized by symptoms including worthlessness, anhedonia, sleep, and appetite disturbances. Recently, studies have suggested that tryptophan (Trp) metabolism plays a key role in depressed mood through serotonin and kynurenine pathway involving enzyme tryptophan 5-monooxygenase (TPH) and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) respectively. Moreover, during neuroinflammation, IDO is activated by proinflammatory cytokines and affects neurogenesis, cognition, disturbed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and gut homeostasis by altering the gut bacteria and its metabolites like Trp derivatives. Furthermore, over the decades, researchers have focused on understanding communication between the human microbiome, especially gut microbiota, and mental health, called gut-brain-axis (GBA), particularly through Trp metabolism. Supplementation of probiotics in depression has gained attention from researchers and clinicians. However, there is limited information about probiotics supplementation on depression involving enzyme IDO and kynurenine pathway metabolites. This review discussed the potential role of probiotics in depression through the tryptophan/kynurenine pathway."

Our aim is ascertaining the association between the physiologic response and the length of the first cycle of prone position and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality.\nMethods: International registry including COVID-19 adult patients who underwent prone positioning. We measured the difference for arterial partial pressure of oxygen to inspired fraction of oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2), ventilatory ratio, and respiratory system compliance (Crs) between baseline supine position and at either the end of the first cycle of prone position (Delta-PP) or re-supination (Delta-PostPP).\nResults: We enrolled 1816 patients from 53 centers. Delta-PP and Delta-PostPP for PaO2/FiO2 were both associated with ICU mortality [OR (95% CI) 0.48 (0.38, 0.59), and OR (95% CI) 0.60 (0.52, 0.68), respectively]. Ventilatory ratio had a non-linear relationship with ICU mortality for Delta-PP (p = 0.022) and Delta-PostPP (p = 0.004). Delta-PP, while not Delta-PostPP, for Crs was associated with ICU mortality [OR (95% CI) 0.80 (0.65, 0.98)]. The length of the first cycle of prone position showed an inverse relationship with ICU mortality [OR (95% CI) 0.82 (0.73, 0.91)]. At the multivariable analysis, the duration of the first cycle of prone position, Delta-PP and Delta-PostPP for PaO2/FiO2, and Delta-PostPP for ventilatory ratio were independently associated with ICU mortality.\nConclusion: In COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and prone positioning, the physiological response to prone position is associated with ICU mortality. Prolonging the duration of the first cycle of prone position is associated with improved survival."

A workflow was developed to screen newborns for 165 treatable pediatric disorders by deep sequencing of regions of interest in 405 genes. The prospective observational BabyDetect pilot project was launched in September 2022 in a maternity ward of a public hospital in the Liege area, Belgium. In this ongoing observational study, 4,260 families have been informed of the project, and 3,847 consented to participate. To date, 71 disease cases have been identified, 30 of which were not detected by conventional NBS. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency was the most frequent disorder detected, with 44 positive individuals. Of the remaining 27 cases, 17 were recessive disorders. We also identified one false-positive case in a newborn in whom two variants in the AGXT gene were identified, which were subsequently shown to be located on the maternal allele. Nine heterozygous variants were identified in genes associated with dominant conditions. Results from the BabyDetect project demonstrate the importance of integrating biochemical and genomic methods in NBS programs. Challenges must be addressed in variant interpretation within a presymptomatic population and in result reporting and diagnostic confirmation."

A single-blind randomized controlled trial assessed an online multidomain lifestyle intervention to prevent cognitive decline over 3 years. Participants were dementia-free community-dwelling Australians aged 55-77 years with modifiable dementia risk factors. Eligible participants (n = 6,104, 64% female) were randomized 1:1 to a personalized schedule of online coaching in two to four modules (targeting physical activity, nutrition, cognitive activity and depression or anxiety) or a control group that received module-eligible information only.

Randomization of this internet-delivered lifestyle intervention tailored to individual dementia risk factors resulted in significantly better cognition in older adults over 3 years. This intervention is scalable with the potential for population-level rollout that may delay cognitive decline in the general community.

    "heading": "Coeliac disease: complications and comorbidities",
    "abstract": "Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease characterized by small intestinal villus atrophy and inflammation upon exposure to gluten. It has a global prevalence of approximately 1%. Although the gluten-free diet can be an effective treatment, this diet is burdensome with practical difficulties and frequent inadvertent gluten exposure. Moreover, there are a variety of potential complications and comorbidities of coeliac disease that might be related to malabsorption and/or chronic immune activation. Overall, individuals with coeliac disease have increased mortality compared with the general population, underscoring the severity of this common disease. Comorbidities and complications that have been associated with coeliac disease include poor growth, reproductive complications, kidney and liver diseases, respiratory disease (such as pneumonia) and infections (including sepsis). Furthermore, coeliac disease has been linked to other autoimmune disease and psychiatric disease, as well as certain cancers. Data suggest that mucosal healing on a gluten-free diet might protect against some, but not all, of these complications. In this Review, we present absolute and relative risks of coeliac-associated disorders. We discuss underlying mechanisms, the role of the gluten-free diet and mucosal healing, as well as implications for follow-up and non-dietary treatment of coeliac disease."

    "abstract": "Several clinical trials suggest that β-glucans may reduce feelings of fatigue, however the results of clinical trials are inconsistent. Additionally, no systematic reviews or meta-analyses have assessed the effects of β-glucans on fatigue. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of β-glucans on fatigue in healthy subjects through a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched from database inception to March 15, 2024. The inclusion criterion was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the effects of β-glucans on healthy subjects' fatigue, vigor, and mood state. To assess risk of bias, we employed the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted for the standardized mean difference (SMD). Sixteen RCTs with a total of 1,449 participants were included, and 12 studies provided data suitable for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that β-glucans significantly reduced feelings of fatigue (SMD = -0.32, 95% CI = -0.53 to -0.12; p = 0.0021), increased vigor (SMD = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.26-0.66; p < 0.0001), and improved mood state (SMD = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.11-0.53; p = 0.0026) compared to the placebo group. The results of the systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that β-glucans may be effective in reducing feelings of fatigue in healthy individuals. However, the number of studies included is insufficient, suggesting that further clinical trials are needed to validate this effect."

    "abstract": "Intratumour hypoxia is a feature of all heterogenous solid tumours. Increased levels or subregions of tumour hypoxia are associated with an adverse clinical prognosis, particularly when this co-occurs with genomic instability. Experimental evidence points to the acquisition of DNA and chromosomal alterations in proliferating hypoxic cells secondary to inhibition of DNA repair pathways such as homologous recombination, base excision repair and mismatch repair. Cell adaptation and selection in repair-deficient cells give rise to a model whereby novel single-nucleotide mutations, structural variants and copy number alterations coexist with altered mitotic control to drive chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. Whole-genome sequencing studies support the concept that hypoxia is a critical microenvironmental cofactor alongside the driver mutations in MYC, BCL2, TP53 and PTEN in determining clonal and subclonal evolution in multiple tumour types. We propose that the hypoxic tumour microenvironment selects for unstable tumour clones which survive, propagate and metastasize under reduced immune surveillance. These aggressive features of hypoxic tumour cells underpin resistance to local and systemic therapies and unfavourable outcomes for patients with cancer. Possible ways to counter the effects of hypoxia to block tumour evolution and improve treatment outcomes are described."

    "abstract": "Although antibody escape is observed in emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants, T cell escape, especially after the global circulation of BA.2.86/JN.1, is unexplored. Here we demonstrate that T cell evasion exists in epitope hotspots spanning BA.2.86/JN.1 mutations. The newly emerging Q229K at this conserved nucleocapsid protein site impairs HLA-A2 epitope hotspot recognition. The association between HLA-A24 convalescents and T cell immune escape points to the spike (S) protein epitope S448-456NYNYLYRLF, with multiple mutations from Delta to JN.1, including L452Q, L452R, F456L, N450D and L452W, and N450D, L452W and L455S. A cliff drop of immune responses was observed for S448-456NYNYRYRLF (Delta/BA.5.2) and S448-456NYDYWYRSF (JN.1), but with immune preservation of S448-456NYDYWYRLF (BA.2.86). Structural analyses showed that hydrophobicity exposure determines the pronounced escape of L452R and L455S mutants, which was further confirmed by T cell receptor binding. This study highlights the characteristics and molecular mechanisms of the T cell immune escape for JN.1 and provides new insights into understanding the dominant circulation of variants, from the viewpoint of cytotoxic T cell evasion."

Dysregulated T cell responses exacerbate coronavirus disease 2019 severity, marked by cytokine storms and respiratory failure. Despite extensive description in peripheral blood, the characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cells in the lungs remain elusive. Here we conducted integrated single-cell profiling of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in 122 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and 280 blood samples from 159 patients, including 27 paired BALF and blood samples from 24 patients. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were robustly elicited in BALF irrespective of prior vaccination, correlating with diminished viral loads, lessened systemic inflammation and improved respiratory function. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in BALF exhibited profound activation, along with proliferative and multi-cytokine-producing capabilities and a glycolysis-driven metabolic signature, which were distinct from those observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. After viral clearance, these specific T cells maintained a polyfunctional tissue-resident memory phenotype, highlighting their critical roles in infection control and long-term protection."

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in which TDP-43, a nuclear RNA-binding protein, forms cytoplasmic inclusions. Here, we have developed a robust and automated method to assess protein self-assembly in the cytoplasm using microtubules as nanoplatforms. Importantly, we have analyzed specifically the self-assembly of full-length TDP-43 and its mRNA binding that are regulated by the phosphorylation of its self-adhesive C-terminus, which is the recipient of many pathological mutations. We show that C-terminus phosphorylation prevents the recruitment of TDP-43 in mRNA-rich stress granules only under acute stress conditions because of a low affinity for mRNA but not under mild stress conditions. In addition, the self-assembly of the C-terminus is negatively regulated by phosphorylation in the cytoplasm which in turn promotes TDP-43 nuclear import. We anticipate that reducing TDP-43 C-terminus self-assembly in the cytoplasm may be an interesting strategy to reverse TDP-43 nuclear depletion in neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Liver x receptor alpha (LXRα) functions as an intracellular cholesterol sensor that regulates lipid metabolism at the transcriptional level in response to the direct binding of cholesterol derivatives. We have generated mice with a mutation in LXRα that reduces activity in response to endogenous cholesterol derived LXR ligands while still allowing transcriptional activation by synthetic agonists. The mutant LXRα functions as a dominant negative that shuts down cholesterol sensing. When fed a high fat, high cholesterol diet LXRα mutant mice rapidly develop pathologies associated with Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) including ballooning hepatocytes, liver inflammation, and fibrosis. Strikingly LXRα mutant mice have decreased liver triglycerides but increased liver cholesterol. Therefore, elevated cholesterol in the liver may play a critical role in the development of MASH. Reengaging LXR signaling by treatment with synthetic agonist reverses MASH in LXRα mutant mice suggesting that LXRα normally functions to impede the development of liver disease."

We screen a ubiquitination-related compound library and determine that the substrate recognition component of the SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, SCFFBXO3(FBXO3), which is a critical lysophagy regulator. Inhibition of FBXO3 reduces lysophagy and lysophagic flux in response to L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe). Furthermore, FBXO3 interacts with TMEM192, leading to its ubiquitination in LLOMe-treated cells. We also identify TAX1BP1 as a critical autophagic adaptor that recognizes ubiquitinated TMEM192 during lysophagy and find that TBK1 activation is crucial for lysophagy, as it phosphorylates FBXO3 in response to lysosomal damage. Knockout of FBXO3 significantly impairs lysophagy, and its reconstitution with a loss-of-function mutant (V221I) further confirms its essential role in lysophagy regulation. Collectively, our findings highlight the significance of the TBK1-FBXO3-TMEM192-TAX1BP1 axis in lysophagy and emphasize the critical role of FBXO3 in lysosomal integrity."

Despite hundreds of GPCR-Gαβγ structures, these snapshots primarily capture the fully activated complex. Consequently, the functions of intermediate GPCR-G protein complexes remain elusive. Guided by a conformational landscape visualized via 19F quantitative NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we determined the structure of an intermediate GPCR-mini-Gαsβγ complex at 2.6 Å using cryo-EM, by blocking its transition to the fully activated complex. Furthermore, we present direct evidence that the complex at this intermediate state initiates a rate-limited nucleotide exchange before transitioning to the fully activated complex. In this state, BODIPY-GDP/GTP based nucleotide exchange assays further indicated the α-helical domain of the Gα is partially open, allowing it to grasp a nucleotide at a non-canonical binding site, distinct from the canonical nucleotide-binding site. These advances bridge a significant gap in our understanding of the complexity of GPCR signaling."

    "abstract": "IL-17A, referred to as IL-17, is the founding member of a family of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E (or IL-25), and IL-17F, which act via receptors IL-17RA to IL-17RE, and elicit potent cellular responses that impact diverse diseases. IL-17's interactions with various cytokines include forming a heterodimer with IL-17F and being stimulated by IL-23's activation of Th17 cells, which can lead to inflammation and autoimmunity. IL-17 is implicated in infectious diseases and inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, promoting neutrophil recruitment and anti-bacterial immunity, but potentially exacerbating fungal and viral infections, revealing its dual role as protective and pathologic. IL-17 is also involved in various cancers, including breast, colon, cervical, prostate, and skin cancer, contributing to proliferation, immune invasion, and metastases, but also playing a protective role in certain instances. Four FDA-approved drugs-secukinumab (for ankylosing spondylitis, enthesitis-related arthritis, hidradenitis suppurativa, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis), ixekizumab (for ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis), brodalumab (for plaque psoriasis), and bimekizumab (for plaque psoriasis)-suppress the IL-17 pathway, with more in development, including netakimab, sonelokimab, izokibep, and CJM112. These agents and others are being studied across a spectrum of disorders. Understanding the complicated interplay between IL-17 and other immune mediators may yield new treatments for inflammatory/autoimmune conditions and malignancies."

Three composite HLSs were calculated: a maternal pregnancy HLS based on prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and diet quality, physical activity, smoking status, and alcohol consumption during pregnancy; a parental pregnancy HLS additionally considering paternal BMI and smoking status; and an infancy HLS based on breastfeeding duration, age of solid food introduction, and exposure to passive smoking. Associations with child BMI (primary outcome) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR, available in 2 cohorts) in early (5-5.5 years), middle (7-8 years), and late childhood (9-12 years) were assessed using linear (BMI and WHtR z-scores) and robust Poisson (International Obesity Task Force [IOTF] categories) regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic confounders.\nResults: Only a small proportion of families had favorable lifestyle factors during pregnancy and early infancy, with 3.4% to 10.0%, 1.9% to 3.7%, and 12.2% to 23.6% scoring maximum for maternal, parental, and infancy HLS, respectively. Associations between higher HLSs and a lower risk of OWOB when measured by BMI z-scores or IOTF categories were found for maternal HLS and early (3/4 cohorts with available data), middle (1/2), and late childhood (2/4); parental HLS and early (3/4), middle (2/2), and late childhood (4/4). Associations between infancy HLS and childhood OWOB were less consistent and did not remain significant after additional adjustment for parental HLS. Associations with WHtR were solely significant in EDEN at 5.5 years.\nConclusions: Greater maternal and parental adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors during pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of offspring OWOB throughout childhood, illustrating the importance of promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors at the family level during pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Background: CheckMate 8HW prespecified dual primary endpoints, assessed in patients with centrally confirmed microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient status: progression-free survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab compared with chemotherapy as first-line therapy and progression-free survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab compared with nivolumab alone, regardless of previous systemic treatment for metastatic disease. In our previous report, nivolumab plus ipilimumab showed superior progression-free survival versus chemotherapy in first-line microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer in the CheckMate 8HW trial. Here, we report results from the prespecified interim analysis for the other primary endpoint of progression-free survival for nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab across all treatment lines.\nMethods: CheckMate 8HW is a randomised, open-label, international, phase 3 trial at 128 hospitals and cancer centres across 23 countries. Immunotherapy-naive adults with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer across different lines of therapy and microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient status per local testing were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to nivolumab plus ipilimumab (nivolumab 240 mg, ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, every 3 weeks for four doses; then nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks; all intravenously), nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks for six doses, then 480 mg every 4 weeks; all intravenously), or chemotherapy with or without targeted therapies. The dual independent primary endpoints were progression-free survival by blinded independent central review with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy (first line) and progression-free survival by blinded independent central review with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab (all lines) in patients with centrally confirmed microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04008030).\nFindings: Between Aug 16, 2019, and April 10, 2023, 707 patients were randomly assigned to nivolumab plus ipilimumab (n=354) or nivolumab alone (n=353). 296 (84%) of 354 patients in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group and 286 (81%) of 353 patients in the nivolumab group were centrally confirmed to have microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient status. At the data cutoff on Aug 28, 2024, median follow-up (from randomisation to data cutoff) was 47·0 months (IQR 38·4 to 53·2). Nivolumab plus ipilimumab treatment showed significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival versus nivolumab (hazard ratio 0·62, 95% CI 0·48-0·81; p=0·0003). Median progression-free survival was not reached with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (95% CI 53·8 to not estimable) and was 39·3 months with nivolumab (22·1 to not estimable). Treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurred in 285 (81%) of 352 patients receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab and in 249 (71%) of 351 patients receiving nivolumab; grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 78 (22%) and 50 (14%) patients, respectively. There were three treatment-related deaths: one event of myocarditis and pneumonitis each in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group and one pneumonitis event in the nivolumab group.\nInterpretation: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab showed superior progression-free survival versus nivolumab across all treatment lines, with a manageable safety profile, in patients with microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer. These results, together with the first-line results of superior progression-free survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy, suggest nivolumab plus ipilimumab as a potential new standard of care for patients with microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer.\nFunding: Bristol Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical."

    "abstract": "Uncommon epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) pose therapeutic challenge due to limited response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This study presents preclinical evidence and mechanistic insights into the combination of lazertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI; and amivantamab, an EGFR-MET bispecific antibody, for treating NSCLC with uncommon EGFR mutations. The lazertinib-amivantamab combination demonstrates significant antitumor activity in patient-derived models with uncommon EGFR mutations either before treatment or after progressing on EGFR-TKIs. Lazertinib enhances the inhibitory capacity of amivantamab by increasing its on-target expression. Notably, the combination surpasses afatinib, a first-line treatment for uncommon EGFR mutations in NSCLC, in terms of in vivo efficacy. Promising clinical activity is also observed in two case studies of patients treated with this combination (NCT04077463). Our findings highlight the potential of the lazertinib-amivantamab combination as a therapeutic strategy for uncommon EGFR mutations, an area of unmet medical need, and support further clinical investigation."

However, whether this coupling exists across the neocortex and the mechanisms enabling it remains unknown. By combining electrophysiology in mouse hippocampus (HPC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) with wide-field imaging of the dorsal neocortex, we found spatially and temporally precise bi-directional hippocampo-neocortical interaction. HPC multi-unit activity and SWR probability were correlated with UP/DOWN states in the default mode network (DMN), with the highest modulation by the RSC in deep sleep. Further, some SWRs were preceded by the high rebound excitation accompanying DMN DOWN → UP transitions, whereas large-amplitude SWRs were often followed by DOWN states originating in the RSC. We explain these electrophysiological results with a model in which the HPC and RSC are weakly coupled excitable systems capable of bi-directional perturbation and suggest that the RSC may act as a gateway through which SWRs can perturb downstream cortical regions via cortico-cortical propagation of DOWN states."

Currently, no FDA-approved treatment exists for sarcopenia. Here, we identified norharmane (NR), a β-carboline alkaloid, as a potential therapeutic agent for mitigating muscle aging. We aimed to determine the ability of NR to delay muscle aging in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), mouse, and muscle cells in mice and humans. NR treatment improved swimming ability and increased the maximum velocity in aged C. elegans. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that NR upregulated detoxification genes in C. elegans, including cytochrome P450, UGT, and GST enzymes. NR-induced benefits were dependent on the SKN-1/Nrf2 stress response pathway. In mammalian models, NR delayed cellular senescence in human skeletal muscle myoblasts and enhanced myogenesis in C2C12 cells and primary aged myoblasts. NR supplementation in aged mice prevented muscle loss, improved muscle function, and reduced markers of cellular senescence. We found that the p38 MAPK pathway mediated NR activation of Nrf2 by disrupting the Nrf2-Keap1 interaction. NR also improved oxygen consumption rates and promoted mitochondrial biogenesis. These findings suggest that NR is a promising candidate for preventing sarcopenia and improving muscle health."

    "abstract": "Health networking is in principle a formidable instrument to address many challenges posed by cancer, one of the two most common and most lethal non-communicable chronic diseases. The European Union (EU)'s Beating Cancer Plan foresaw the addition of new health networks to the four already existing European Reference Networks on rare cancers: the Network of Comprehensive Cancer Centres and several networks of expertise (NoEs), which will be shortly deployed on items as complex and poor-prognosis cancers, palliative care, survivorship, personalised primary and secondary prevention, omic technologies, hi-tech medical resources, and cancers in adolescents and young adults. The community of experts of the EU Joint Action, due to build such NoEs, has drafted this 'green paper', incorporating 13 open questions, in an effort to foster discussion on some open questions about health networking on cancer in the EU. These affect highly diverse issues such as the following: how gaps in research into the instrument of health networking may be filled; which items lend themselves more to health networking in the EU; what degree of cooperation and harmonisation should be required of EU member states to best exploit health networking and give rise to European networks of national/regional networks; how the idea of subsidiarity may be best interpreted to support health networking in the context of EU treaties, which basically do not include health; how health networks should be funded and with what degree of cooperation between the EU and national levels; whether EU health networks should be shaped as legal entities or could give rise to secondary legal entities, also with a view to fundraising; how health networks should be best shaped to advance cancer research and how the EU regulatory system should be updated to exploit such impulse to health networks, in view of the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the new EU Health Data Space; how artificial intelligence can be exploited today within health networks and to what extent it will be able to overcome challenges such as the current lack of interoperability of electronic health records and the language barrier across the EU; and how health networks should involve patients and their groups, with regard to their formal role within EU health networks as well as their ability to have a say in items such as production of clinical practice guidelines, the design of investigator-driven clinical trials, EU regulatory decisions on medicines and devices, health service data governance, and identification of unmet needs."

All the characteristics of using mobile phones and playing computer games were collected through face-to-face interviews at baseline, and outcomes were extracted from the algorithmic combinations of self-reported medical conditions, hospital admissions, and death registries. In addition, a group of participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at follow-up. Cox regression and linear regression were performed.\nResults: The study included over 270,000 participants for risk analysis, with a mean baseline age of approximately 55.85 (SD 8.07) years. The average follow-up duration was approximately 13.9 (SD 1.99) years. Lengthy mobile phone use was associated with a reduced risk of ACD (2-4 years: hazard ratio [HR] 0.815, 95% CI 0.729-0.912, P<.001; 5-8 years: HR 0.749, 95% CI 0.677-0.829, P<.001; >8 years: HR 0.830, 95% CI 0.751-0.918, P<.001), AD (5-8 years: HR 0.787, 95% CI 0.672-0.922, P=.003), and VD (2-4 years: HR 0.616, 95% CI 0.477-0.794, P<.001; 5-8 years: HR 0.729, 95% CI 0.589-0.902, P=.004; >8 years: HR 0.750, 95% CI 0.605-0.930, P=.009) compared to rarely using mobile phones. Additionally, lengthy mobile phone use was linked to a decreased risk of ACP (5-8 years: HR 0.747, 95% CI 0.637-0.875, P<.001; >8 years: HR 0.774, 95% CI 0.663-0.904, P=.001) and PD (5-8 years: HR 0.760, 95% CI 0.644-0.897, P=.001; >8 years: HR 0.777, 95% CI 0.660-0.913, P=.002) in participants older than 60 years. However, higher weekly usage time did not confer additional risk reduction compared to lower weekly usage of mobile phones. The neuroimaging analysis involved 35,643 participants, with an average duration of approximately 9.0 years between baseline and neuroimaging scans. Lengthy mobile phone use was related to a thicker cortex in different areas of the brain.\nConclusions: Lengthy mobile phone use is associated with a reduced risk of neurodegenerative diseases and improved brain structure compared to minimal usage. Our research provides valuable background knowledge for future studies on the impact of modern electronic devices on brain health."

    "abstract": "To assess efficacy and safety of dapsone in adult immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a real-word study cohort were performed. Participants were adults with primary ITP, transient response to corticosteroids ± intravenous immunoglobulin, and a platelet count ≤ 30x109/L (or ≤ 50x109/L with bleeding). Patients in the RCT were randomized in arm A (prednisone x3weeks+dapsone for 12 months) or arm B (prednisone alone). The observational study involved dapsone initiation at 100 mg/d with standard follow-up. The primary endpoint was the response rate (platelet count >30x109/L and ≥2×baseline) at 52 weeks, with the response rate at 24 weeks and adverse events as secondary endpoints. The RCT enrolled 93 patients (54.8% female), median age 48.5 years (46 in arm A, 47 in arm B). In the intention-to-treat analysis, 78.3% of patients in group A discontinued dapsone after a median of 4.6 weeks due to adverse events (66.7%) or lack of efficacy (33.3%). The response rate at week 52 was 21.7% (95% CI:10.9%-36.4%) in group A versus 8.5% (95% CI:2.7%-18.6%) in group B (p=0.17). The observational study, which was conducted after the end of the RCT, included 46 patients (52.2% female), median age 50.7 years. Adverse events occurred in 30.4%, leading to discontinuation of dapsone in 23.9%, and 13.6% (95% CI: 5.2%-27.4%) met the primary efficacy endpoint. Results from both studies showed an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio for the use of dapsone in adult primary ITP and suggest that, whenever available, second-line options should be used.

CD19-targeting Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells have changed the prognosis of chemoresistant LBCL. Clinical and pathological data of patients treated for relapsed/refractory LBCL or HGBL in third line or more, all characterized by FISH, were collected from the French DESCAR-T registry. Between January 2018 and November 2022, 228 patients were included across 14 centers, 73 with HGBL (28 HGBL-DH MYC-BCL2, 14 HGBL-TH, 8 HGBL-DH MYC-BCL6, 23 HGBL-NOS) and 155 with non-HGBL. Median follow-up was 18.5 months [95% CI, 14.3-23.4] from the date of infusion. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were not significantly different between HGBL and non-HGBL, at respectively 3.2 months [95% CI, 2.8-6.0] vs 4.5 months [95% CI, 3.1-8.7] (p = 0.103) and 15.4 months [95% CI, 5.6-32.4] vs 18.3 months [95% CI, 8.5-NR]. From the date of eligibility, the median OS was inferior for patients with HGBL-TH/DH MYC-BCL2 at 6.6 months vs 18.5 months for HGBL-NOS vs 13.6 months for HGBL-DH MYC-BCL6 vs 11.8 months for LBCL (p = 0.037). However, infused patients presented the same outcome. CAR T-cell therapy used in third line or more seems to overcome the poor prognosis of HGBL subtypes, especially in HGBL-TH/DH MYC-BCL2. This observation supports considering the potential benefit of using CAR-T earlier in the course of the disease."

Some pts achieve molecular responses (MR), but clonal factors sensitizing for MR remain elusive. We integrated colony formation and differentiation assays with single-cell RNA seq and genotyping in PV-derived cells vs. healthy controls (HC) to dissect how IFNa targets diseased clones during erythroid differentiation. IFNa significantly decreased colony growth in MPN and HC, with variable transcriptional responses observed in individual colonies. scRNAseq of colonies demonstrated more mature erythroid PV-derived colonies compared with HC. JAK2V617F-mutant cells exhibited upregulated STAT5A, heme, and G2M checkpoint pathways compared to JAK2WT cells from the same pts. Subgroup analysis revealed that IFNa significantly decreased immature erythrocytic cells in PV (basophilic erythroblasts p<0.05; polychromatic erythroblasts p<0.05) but not in HC. CD71-/CD235a+ cells from HC (p<0.05) but not from PV pts were inhibited by IFNa, and number of reticulocytes was less affected in PV. Robust IFNa responses persisted throughout differentiation, leading to significant apoptosis in PV. Apoptotic cells displayed downregulation of ribosomal genes. This link between apoptosis and ribosomal genes was corroborated through analysis of mitochondrial variants demonstrating IFNa-induced eradication of specific clones, characterized by elevated expression of ribosomal genes. Our findings indicate that PV-derived clones either undergo apoptosis or pass through differentiation, overall reducing cycling mutant cells over long-term treatment. Further, the significance of ribosomal genes and clonal prerequisites in IFNa's therapeutic mechanism is underscored, shedding light on the intricate dynamics of IFNa treatment in PV."

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the triple therapy againts persistent cough, the clinical effect of regular treatment with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI) or placebo in adult patients with asthma was investigated. Methods This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group multicentre trial recruited asthma patients with persistent cough from hospitals and primary care clinics between June 2022 and December 2023. Participants were randomly given FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25 μg or placebo for 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was the average change in the cough symptom score from baseline to week 6. Secondary outcomes were effectiveness on cough-related disease burdens (asthma control questionnaire [ACQ]-5, Leicester cough questionnaire [LCQ] and night-time awakening). Furthermore, lung function and adverse events were evaluated.Results The decrease from baseline in the cough symptom score at week 6 was significantly greater in the FF/UMEC/VI group than in the placebo group (p = 0.006). The ACQ-5 scores showed a greater decrease in the FF/UMEC/VI group than in the placebo group. The change from baseline in morning and evening FEV1 increased in the FF/UMEC/VI group as with the results of peak expiratory flow. No significant adverse events associated with FF/UMEC/VI were noted.Conclusions In asthma patients with persistent cough, FF/UMEC/VI showed an early response and a significant effect on cough and lung function for 6 weeks of treatment.This study is registered with jRCTs031210412."

    "abstract": "Mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) are associated with familial Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 phosphorylates Rab guanosine triphosphatase (GTPases) within the Switch II domain while PINK1 directly phosphorylates Parkin and ubiquitin (Ub) and indirectly induces phosphorylation of a subset of Rab GTPases. Herein we have crossed LRRK2 [R1441C] mutant knock-in mice with PINK1 knock-out (KO) mice and report that loss of PINK1 does not impact endogenous LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation nor do we see significant effect of mutant LRRK2 on PINK1-mediated Rab and Ub phosphorylation. In addition, we observe that a pool of the Rab-specific, protein phosphatase family member 1H phosphatase, is transcriptionally up-regulated and recruited to damaged mitochondria, independent of PINK1 or LRRK2 activity. Parallel signaling of LRRK2 and PINK1 pathways is supported by assessment of motor behavioral studies that show no evidence of genetic interaction in crossed mouse lines. Previously we showed loss of cilia in LRRK2 R1441C mice and herein we show that PINK1 KO mice exhibit a ciliogenesis defect in striatal cholinergic interneurons and astrocytes that interferes with Hedgehog induction of glial derived-neurotrophic factor transcription. This is not exacerbated in double-mutant LRRK2 and PINK1 mice. Overall, our analysis indicates that LRRK2 activation and/or loss of PINK1 function along parallel pathways to impair ciliogenesis, suggesting a convergent mechanism toward PD. Our data suggest that reversal of defects downstream of ciliogenesis offers a common therapeutic strategy for LRRK2 or PINK1 PD patients, whereas LRRK2 inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials are unlikely to benefit PINK1 PD patients."

    "abstract": "The ε4 variant of human apolipoprotein E (APOE4) is a key genetic risk factor for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and elevated all-cause mortality in humans. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that can mitigate the harmful effects of APOE4 has significant implications. In this study, we find that inactivating the VHL-1 (Von Hippel-Lindau) protein can suppress mortality, neural and behavioral pathologies caused by transgenic human APOE4 in Caenorhabditis elegans. The protective effects of VHL-1 deletion are recapitulated by stabilized HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor), a transcription factor degraded by VHL-1. HIF-1 activates a genetic program that safeguards against mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, proteostasis imbalance, and endolysosomal rupture-critical cellular events linked to neural pathologies and mortality. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Vhl reduces cerebral vascular injury and synaptic lesions in APOE4 mice, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. Thus, we identify the VHL-HIF axis as a potent modulator of APOE4-induced neural pathologies and propose that targeting this pathway in nonproliferative tissues may curb cellular damage, protect against neurodegeneration, and reduce tissue injuries and mortality."

    "abstract": "The formation of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) filaments has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although the disulfide bond formed between Cys57 and Cys146 in the active state has been well studied, the role of the reduced cysteine residues, Cys6 and Cys111, in SOD1 filament formation remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of reduced cysteine residues by determining and comparing cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of wild-type (WT) and C6A/C111A SOD1 filaments under thiol-based reducing and metal-depriving conditions, starting with protein samples possessing enzymatic activity. The C6A/C111A mutant SOD1 formed filaments more rapidly than the WT protein. The mutant structure had a unique paired-protofilament arrangement, with a smaller filament core than that of the single-protofilament structure observed in WT SOD1. Although the single-protofilament form developed more slowly, cross-seeding experiments demonstrated the predominance of single-protofilament morphology over paired protofilaments, regardless of the presence of the Cys6 and Cys111 mutations. These findings highlight the importance of the number of amino acid residues within the filament core in determining the energy requirements for assembly. Our study provides insights into ALS pathogenesis by elucidating the initiation and propagation of filament formation, which potentially leads to deleterious amyloid filaments."

    "abstract": "Aim: Sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) is a common sleep disorder associated with heightened cardiovascular risks, yet sex-specific differences in these risks remain unclear.\nMethods: This retrospective observational cohort study utilized the JMDC Claims Database, covering >5 million individuals in Japan. We analyzed data from 4,173,702 individuals (2,406,930 men, 1,766,772 women) after excluding those with central SAS, cardiovascular disease, and incomplete lifestyle questionnaire data. SAS was identified using ICD-10 codes and treatment records. Cox regression models adjusted for multiple factors examined the association between SAS and cardiovascular outcomes.\nResults: Among the participants, 39,078 men (1.62%) and 3,960 women (0.22%) were diagnosed with SAS. Over a mean follow-up of 1,290±1,000 days, SAS was associated with an increased risk of composite cardiovascular events, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.27 (95% CI, 1.23-1.31) in men and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.54-1.92) in women compared to those without SAS. The association was significantly stronger in women than in men (P-value for interaction< 0.001) and this sex difference was validated by various sensitivity analyses.\nConclusions: Despite the lower prevalence of SAS among women, there was a gender disparity in the cardiovascular impact of SAS, with women demonstrating a significantly higher risk compared to men. This underscores the importance of tailored management strategies aimed at early detection and cardiovascular disease prevention specifically in female patients with SAS."

    "abstract": "Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding transthyretin (TTR). Despite amyloid deposition being pathognomonic for diagnosis, this pathology in nervous tissues cannot fully account for nerve degeneration, implying additional pathophysiology for neurodegeneration, which, however, has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, neuroinflammation in ATTRv-PN was investigated by examining nerve morphometry, the blood-nerve barrier, and macrophage infiltration in the sural nerves of ATTRv-PN patients and the sciatic nerves of a complementary mouse system, i.e. the humanized knock-in hTTRA97S mice. The direct effects of mutant TTR proteins were evaluated in these hTTRA97S mice and a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) model in vivo and in vitro, respectively. This case-control and cross-sectional study included 19 patients (17 men; 62.9 ± 3.9 years; FAP stage 1, n=11; FAP stage 2, n=7; FAP stage 3, n=1) with p.Ala117Ser (A97S) and 46 patients (39 men; 65.3 ± 11.4 years; FAP stage 1, n=31; FAP stage 2, n=12; FAP stage 3, n=3) with p.Val50Met (V30M). Both genotypes had elevated protein in the cerebrospinal fluid: 88.9% (16 cases in 18 patients) in A97S and 51.1% (23 cases in 45 patients) in V30M. The myelinated nerve fibers in sural nerves were markedly depleted in ATTRv-PN and the myelinated nerve fiber density was inversely correlated with CSF protein, implying leakage of the blood-nerve barrier. The tight junction ultrastructure of the endoneurial microvessels in sural nerves was impaired, as indicated by the reduced expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). The cultured HUVEC that were not transfected with any TTR gene variant presented reduced ZO-1 expression when exposed to mutant recombinant TTR of A97S or V30M compared to wild-type TTR. Increased infiltration of macrophage with expression of inflammasome maker, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), suggested polarization to proinflammatory M1 lineage were robust in the sural nerves of ATTRv-PN patients and the sciatic nerves of hTTRA97S mice compared with those of controls and wild-type mice. In parallel, the mRNA expression of interleukin 1β was greater in the sural nerves of ATTRv-PN than in those of the controls. In conclusion, the disrupted blood-nerve barrier due to mutant TTR protein resulting in increased CSF protein level was associated with nerve degeneration in ATTRv-PN via the infiltration of inflammatory macrophages and the production of inflammatory cytokines."

The study focused on identifying predictive biomarkers from species profiles and functional genes, integrating protein-protein interaction analyses to explore effector-like proteins and their targets in key signalling pathways.\nResults: Distinct microbial signatures were identified across autoimmune disorders, with notable overlaps between SLE and IBD, suggesting shared microbial underpinnings. Significant predictive biomarkers highlighted the diverse microbial influences across these conditions. Protein-protein interaction analyses revealed interactions targeting glucocorticoid signalling, antigen presentation and interleukin-12 signalling pathways, offering insights into possible common disease mechanisms. Experimental validation confirmed interactions between the host protein glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and specific gut bacteria-derived proteins, which may have therapeutic implications for inflammatory disorders like SLE and IBD.\nConclusions: Our findings underscore the gut microbiome's critical role in autoimmune diseases, offering insights into shared and distinct microbial signatures. The study highlights the potential importance of microbial biomarkers in understanding disease mechanisms and guiding treatment strategies, paving the way for novel therapeutic approaches based on microbial profiles.\nTrial registration number: NCT02394964."

A nominal group technique exercise was performed in two rounds to define questions underpinning a subsequent systematic literature review. The evidence derived was discussed and overarching principles, recommendations and future research agenda were iteratively developed with voting rounds.\nResults: The task force agreed on 22 recommendations covering 8 clinical/organ domains including Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ulcers, pulmonary arterial hypertension, scleroderma renal crisis, skin fibrosis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), gastrointestinal manifestations and arthritis. Most new recommendations are related to skin fibrosis and ILD. These included novel recommendations for the use of mycophenolate mofetil, nintedanib, rituximab and tocilizumab for the treatment of these crucial disease manifestations. The recommendations also included first-line and second-line interventions, providing increased utility for rheumatology practitioners. Important additions to the future research agenda included consideration of novel interventions for the management of vascular, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal manifestations and calcinosis, as well as for the local management of digital ulcers.\nConclusion: These updated recommendations include the first set of synthetic and biological targeted therapies recommended for key fibrotic manifestations of SSc as well as first-line combination treatment for newly diagnosed pulmonary artery hypertension and prioritise a new research agenda for the coming years."

The efficacy of CD19-CAR T-cell therapy is presumably based on deep tissue depletion of B cells; however, such effect has not been proven in humans in vivo.\nMethods: Sequential ultrasound-guided inguinal lymph node biopsies were performed at baseline and after CD19-CAR T-cell therapy in patients with AIDs. Results were compared with lymph node biopsies from rituximab (RTX)-treated AID patients with absence of peripheral B cells. Conventional and immunohistochemistry staining were performed on lymph node tissue to assess architecture as well the number of B cells, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), plasma cells, T cells and macrophages.\nResults: Sequential lymph node biopsies were analysed from five patients with AID before and after CD19-CAR T-cell therapy and from five patients with AID after RTX treatment. In addition, non-lymphoid organ biopsies (colon, kidney and gallbladder) from three additional patients with AID after CD19-CAR T-cell therapy were analysed. CD19+ and CD20+ B cells were completely depleted in the lymph nodes after CD19-CAR T-cell therapy, but not after RTX treatment. Plasma cells, T cells and macrophages in the lymph nodes remained unchanged. Follicular structures were disrupted and FDCs were depleted in the lymph nodes after CD19-CAR T-cell therapy, but not after RTX. Non-lymphoid organs were completely depleted of B cells.\nDiscussion: This study demonstrates complete B-cell depletion in secondary lymphoid tissues of patients with AIDs following CD19-CAR T-cell therapy combined with standard lymphodepleting therapy."

    "abstract": "RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays diverse roles in RNA metabolism and its deregulation contributes to tumor initiation and progression. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by near ubiquitous loss of VHL followed by mutations in epigenetic regulators PBRM1, SETD2, and BAP1. Mutations in SETD2, a histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylase (H3K36me3), are associated with reduced survival, greater metastatic propensity, and metabolic reprogramming. While m6A and H3K36me3 deregulation are separately implicated in renal tumorigenesis, H3K36me3 may participate directly in m6A targeting, but the m6A-H3K36me3 interplay has not been investigated in the context of ccRCC. Using RCC-relevant SETD2 isogenic knockout and rescue cell line models, we demonstrate a dynamic redistribution of m6A in the SETD2 depleted transcriptome, with a subset of transcripts involved in metabolic reprogramming demonstrating SETD2 dependent m6A and expression level changes. Using a panel of six histone modifications we show that m6A redistributes to regions enriched in gained active enhancers upon SETD2 inactivation. Finally, we demonstrate a reversal of transcriptomic programs involved in SETD2 loss mediated metabolic reprogramming, and reduced cell viability through pharmacologic inhibition or genetic ablation of m6A writer METTL3 specific to SETD2 deficient cells. Thus, targeting m6A may represent a novel therapeutic vulnerability in SETD2 mutant ccRCC."

Given the known roles of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in immune responses and fibrotic diseases, we investigated their involvement in PD-induced peritoneal fibrosis to identify potential therapeutic targets.\nMethods: We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to characterize the activation and function of peritoneal MAIT cells in patients undergoing long-term PD. Our investigation focused on the molecular pathways activated by these cells, particularly the MHC class I-related protein 1 (MR1)-mediated interaction with mesothelial cells and subsequent activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. We further assessed the impact of inhibiting MAIT cells on fibrogenesis using both in vitro models and Mr1 knockout mice.\nResults: Our study revealed that long-term PD significantly enhanced the activation of MAIT cells, particularly the pro-inflammatory MAIT17 subtype. These activated cells contributed to peritoneal fibrogenesis by binding to the MR1 receptor on mesothelial cells, which triggered hyperglycolysis through the mTORC1 pathway, ultimately leading to fibrogenesis. Notably, we demonstrated that blocking the MR1-MAIT interaction, either through genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition with acetyl-6-formylpterin (Ac-6-FP), effectively mitigated fibrosis.\nConclusions: This study identified MAIT cells as crucial drivers of PD-induced peritoneal fibrosis."

Loss of satellite cell pool and function leads to skeletal muscle wasting in many conditions and disease states. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) were increased in satellite cells after muscle injury. Conditional ablation of Fn14 in Pax7-expressing satellite cells drastically reduced their expansion and skeletal muscle regeneration following injury. Fn14 was required for satellite cell self-renewal and proliferation as well as to prevent precocious differentiation. Targeted deletion of Fn14 inhibited Notch signaling but led to the spurious activation of STAT3 signaling in regenerating skeletal muscle and in cultured muscle progenitor cells. Silencing of STAT3 improved proliferation and inhibited premature differentiation of Fn14-deficient satellite cells. Furthermore, conditional ablation of Fn14 in satellite cells exacerbated myopathy in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) whereas its overexpression improved the engraftment of exogenous muscle progenitor cells into the dystrophic muscle of mdx mice. Altogether, our study highlights the crucial role of Fn14 in the regulation of satellite cell fate and function and suggests that Fn14 can be a potential molecular target to improve muscle regeneration in muscular disorders."

This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties and construct validity of the Italian version of the 13-item Patient Activation Measure (PAM13-I) among patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A multicenter study was conducted across 111 surgical units in Italy. This study involved the preoperative administration of the PAM questionnaire to 4532 patients.

While fit statistics were acceptable, ceiling effects were observed. No significant differential item functioning was found. However, issues with targeting and local response dependency were identified.

    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) encompass a diverse set of malignancies with limited precision therapy options. Recently, therapies targeting DLL3 have shown clinical efficacy in aggressive NENs, including small cell lung cancers and neuroendocrine prostate cancers. Given the continued development and expansion of DLL3-targeted therapies, we sought to characterize the expression of DLL3 and identify its clinical and molecular correlates across diverse neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cancers. Here, we interrogated paired DNA and RNA-sequencing from 1,589 NENs across 29 sites, as well as 203,252 tumors across 47 cancer types. We found that high transcriptomic levels of DLL3 correlated with more aggressive histologic and mutational patterns in NENs, with adverse survival outcomes being reflected in NENs originating from the lung, pancreas, stomach, and small bowel. The heterogeneity in DLL3 expression across NENs was largely explained by site of origin, with lung, prostate, and bladder NENs exhibiting relatively high levels of DLL3 whereas gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NENs displayed relatively low expression levels. Although the therapeutic targeting of DLL3 may be less applicable for GEP-NENs, we did find an upregulation of alternative targets such as SEZ6, CELSR3, and SSTR2 in these settings. Lastly, expanding our investigation into non-neuroendocrine cancers, we detected an enrichment of DLL3 in both low-grade and high-grade gliomas, Merkel cell carcinomas, medulloblastomas, and melanomas, with such enrichment being associated with prolonged overall survival in gliomas, but worse overall survival in melanomas. Altogether, we demonstrate that DLL3 represents an attractive target for subsets of neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cancers and uncover opportunities for future therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Importance: The net clinical effect of early vs later direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) initiation after atrial fibrillation-associated ischemic stroke is unclear.\nObjective: To investigate whether early DOAC treatment is associated with a net clinical benefit (NCB).\nDesign, setting, and participants: This was a post hoc analysis of the Early Versus Late Initiation of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Post-Ischaemic Stroke Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (ELAN) open-label randomized clinical trial conducted across 103 sites in 15 countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia between November 6, 2017, and September 12, 2022, with a 90-day follow-up. Participants included patients with atrial fibrillation-associated acute ischemic stroke, excluding those with therapeutic anticoagulation at stroke onset or with severe hemorrhagic transformation of the ischemic infarct.\nIntervention: Early DOAC initiation (<48 hours after minor and moderate stroke, 6-7 days after major stroke) vs later initiation (3-4 days after minor stroke, 6-7 days after moderate stroke, and 12-14 days after major stroke).\nMain outcomes and measures: The main measure was the NCB of early treatment over later treatment, calculated by subtracting the weighted rate of excess bleeding events (major extracranial or intracranial hemorrhage) attributable to early treatment from the rate of excess ischemic events (recurrent stroke or systemic embolism) possibly prevented by early treatment within 30 days (main analysis) or 90 days (ancillary analysis). An established weighting scheme was used to account for the different clinical impact of bleeding relative to ischemic outcomes. Event rates were derived from adjusted logistic models. The analysis included all evaluable randomized ELAN participants.\nResults: Of the original 2013 ELAN participants, 1966 were eligible for analysis (977 [49.7%] assigned to early DOAC initiation, 989 [50.3%] assigned to later DOAC initiation; median [IQR] age 77 [70-84] years; 1075 [54.7%] male). The 30-day NCB of early treatment over later treatment ranged from 1.73 (95% CI, 0.06-3.40) to 1.72 (95% CI, -0.63 to 3.98) weighted events possibly prevented per 100 participants for intracranial hemorrhage weights 1.5 to 3.3. The 90-day NCB ranged from 2.16 (95% CI, 0.30-3.87) to 2.14 (95% CI, -0.26 to 4.41) weighted events per 100 participants.\nConclusions and relevance: This post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial estimated a sizeable NCB of early anticoagulation for patients after atrial fibrillation-associated ischemic stroke. Although estimates cannot exclude the possibility of no benefit or small net harm, the findings suggest that early treatment may be more favorable.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03148457."

The secondary end points included various composites of the mRS at 5 and 12 weeks, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and infarct volume. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted.\nResults: A total of 496 patients were enrolled across 24 Korean stroke centers, of whom 39 dropped out (254 men [55.6%]; mean [SD] age, 72.9 [12.1] years). Baseline characteristics of study participants did not significantly differ. For the primary end point, the distribution of the mRS scores at 12 weeks did not significantly differ between the nelonemdaz and placebo groups (common odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.69-1.31). For the secondary end points, a median of mRS at 5 weeks (3 vs 3) and mRS 0 at 12 weeks (18.1% vs 18.2%) did not differ substantially between groups. The occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (2.7% vs 0.9%) and infarct volume within 24 hours of the last trial drug infusion (42 vs 38 mL) did not differ significantly between groups. No serious adverse events were reported regarding the trial drug and placebo.\nConclusions and relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, nelonemdaz did not meet the primary efficacy end point compared with placebo.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05041010."

Young adults (aged 22-36 years) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), urine toxicology, and cannabis use data were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from January 31 to July 30, 2024.\nExposures: History of heavy cannabis use was assessed using the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism, with variables for lifetime history and diagnosis of cannabis dependence. Individuals were grouped as heavy lifetime cannabis users if they had greater than 1000 uses, as moderate users if they had 10 to 999 uses, and as nonusers if they had fewer than 10 uses. Participants provided urine samples on the day of scanning to assess recent use. Diagnosis of cannabis dependence (per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria) was also included.\nMain outcomes and measures: Brain activation was assessed during each of the 7 tasks administered during the functional MRI session (working memory, reward, emotion, language, motor, relational assessment, and theory of mind). Mean activation from regions associated with the primary contrast for each task was used. The primary analysis was a linear mixed-effects regression model (one model per task) examining the association of lifetime cannabis and recent cannabis use on the mean brain activation value.\nResults: The sample comprised 1003 adults (mean [SD] age, 28.7 [3.7] years; 470 men [46.9%] and 533 women [53.1%]). A total of 63 participants were Asian (6.3%), 137 were Black (13.7%), and 762 were White (76.0%). For lifetime history criteria, 88 participants (8.8%) were classified as heavy cannabis users, 179 (17.8%) as moderate users, and 736 (73.4%) as nonusers. Heavy lifetime use (Cohen d = -0.28 [95% CI, -0.50 to -0.06]; false discovery rate corrected P = .02) was associated with lower activation on the working memory task. Regions associated with a history of heavy use included the anterior insula, medial prefrontal cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Recent cannabis use was associated with poorer performance and lower brain activation in the working memory and motor tasks, but the associations between recent use and brain activation did not survive false discovery rate correction. No other tasks were associated with lifetime history of heavy use, recent use, or dependence diagnosis.\nConclusions and relevance: In this study of young adults, lifetime history of heavy cannabis use was associated with lower brain activation during a working memory task. These findings identify negative outcomes associated with heavy lifetime cannabis use and working memory in healthy young adults that may be long lasting."

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that individuals infected with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to those who are not infected. However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to systematically evaluate the mediating roles of 3,283 plasma proteins in the link between COVID-19 susceptibility and T2D by conducting proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Reverse MR, validation in independent datasets, and colocalization analyses were conducted to verify the robustness of the MR results. Furthermore, mediation analysis was carried out to quantify the mediating effects. MR analyses between protein and T2D-related phenotypes were conducted to enhance the comprehension of potential mechanisms. Finally, the druggability of the identified proteins was evaluated. Four proteins causally associated with susceptibility to COVID-19 (ABO, CD209, CUZD1, and QXOS2) exhibited significant causal links with T2D. The protein CD209, which exhibited significant associations in validation and colocalization analyses, was identified as the causal mediating protein. Mediation analysis indicated that CD209 significantly mediated the total effect from COVID-19 susceptibility to T2D ( βindirect[95%CI]: 0.083[0.014-0.152], P=0.019). Further MR analyses revealed significant associations between CD209 and hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and waist-to-hip ratio. Evaluation of druggability demonstrated that CD209 can bind to Alpha-D-mannose and interact with 9 targets of T2D drugs including dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Our findings propose CD209 as a potential intervention target in individuals infected with COVID-19 to prevent T2D, providing novel insights into the pathophysiology linking COVID-19 and T2D."

    "abstract": "Background: In patients with post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), stent recanalization of iliofemoral veins or the inferior vena cava can restore venous patency and improve functional outcomes. The risk of stent thrombosis is particularly increased during the first 6 months after intervention. The ARIVA trial tested whether daily aspirin 100 mg plus rivaroxaban 20 mg is superior to rivaroxaban 20 mg alone to prevent stent thrombosis within 6 months after stent placement for PTS.\nMethods: In this multinational, academic, open-label, independently adjudicated trial, patients with a Villalta score >4 points, a stenosis or occlusion of the inferior vena cava, iliac veins, or common femoral vein, successfully treated with venous stent placement, were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the study groups. Key exclusion criteria included age <18 or >75 years, contraindications to anticoagulant use or acute venous thrombosis <3 months. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of no occlusion in the treated segment assessed at serial duplex ultrasound examinations or no re-intervention needed to maintain patency within 6 months. Secondary outcomes, including Villalta score, quality of life, and safety outcomes were also assessed. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04128956).\nResults: From 2020 through 2022, 172 patients were screened, 169 randomized and 162 included in the full analysis set, receiving either aspirin plus rivaroxaban (n=80) or rivaroxaban alone (n=82) for six months. Mean age was 42.8 (standard deviation 14.7) years, 103 (60.9%) patients were women, 154 (97.5%) were Caucasian, and leg ulcers were present in 7% patients. The primary patency rate at six months was 94.8% vs. 92.4% (absolute risk difference: 2.4%; 95 %CI -13.6%; +18.0%), respectively. The mean decrease in the Villalta score for the affected leg (without ulcer) from baseline to 6 months was -6.7 (SD 4.4) and -7.0 (SD 5.2) points (p-value 0.36), respectively. There were no differences in other outcomes or quality of life at 6 months. No major bleeding occurred.\nConclusions: The overall primary patency rate during the first six months following endovascular intervention for PTS was higher than expected and comparable between patients receiving aspirin combined with rivaroxaban and those receiving rivaroxaban alone."

    "abstract": "Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) entail a diverse group of disorders resulting from hereditary or de novo mutations in single genes, leading to immune dysregulation. This study explores the clinical utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques in diagnosing monogenic immune defects. Eight patients attending the immunodeficiency clinic and with unclassified antibody deficiency were included in the analysis. Clinical records, immune characteristics, and family histories were reviewed, and a target gene panel (TGP) sequencing was performed to identify pathogenic variants. TGPs identified seven variants in TNFRSF13B (TACI), CARMIL2, STAT1, STAT3, and ORAI1 genes. These findings provided definitive diagnoses and proper prognostic assessment. Patients exhibited a wide range of clinical manifestations, including recurrent infections, autoimmune cytopenias, and organ-specific complications. The genetic diversity observed highlights the importance of genetic testing in diagnosing IEIs and tailoring treatments. This study underscores the role of TGPs in diagnosing IEIs, revealing significant genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic variability. They offer a precise tool for identifying underlying genetic defects, facilitating personalized medicine approaches, and eventually improving patient outcomes. The findings emphasize the need for comprehensive genetic testing to uncover novel pathogenic variants, enhancing our understanding of immune system dysfunction. NGS is a critical tool for the management of IEI, enabling precise diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies. Despite resource limitations, the progressive affordability is likely to expand its clinical utility, ultimately improving patient care and advancing the field of immunology. In the meantime, accurate phenotypic assessment is essential for resource optimization and case prioritization."

This study aimed to examine the prognostic value of TR before and after M-TEER.\nMethods: Patients in the OCEAN-Mitral registry were divided into four groups according to baseline and post-procedure echocardiographic assessments: no TR/no TR (no TR), no TR/significant TR (new-onset TR), significant TR/no TR (normalized TR), and significant TR/significant TR (residual TR) (all represents before/after M-TEER). Tricuspid regurgitation ≥ moderate was defined as significant. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization. Tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient was also evaluated.\nResults: The numbers of patients in each group were 2103 (no TR), 201 (new-onset TR), 504 (normalized TR), and 858 (residual TR). Baseline assessment for TR and TR pressure gradient was not associated with outcomes after M-TEER. In contrast, patients with new-onset TR had the highest adjusted risk for the primary outcome, followed by those with residual TR [compared with no TR as a reference, hazard ratio 1.83 (95% confidence interval: 1.39-2.40) for new-onset TR, 1.45 (1.23-1.72) for residual TR, and 0.82 (0.65-1.04) for normalized TR]. Similarly, from baseline to post-procedure, TR pressure gradient changes were associated with subsequent outcomes after M-TEER. New-onset and residual TR incidence was commonly associated with dilated tricuspid annulus diameter and atrial fibrillation.\nConclusions: Post-procedural TR, but not baseline TR, was associated with outcomes after M-TEER. Careful TR assessment after the procedure would provide an optimal management for concomitant significant TR in patients undergoing M-TEER."

    "abstract": "Inflammatory cytokines are fundamental mediators of the organismal response to injury, infection, or other harmful stimuli. To elucidate the early and mostly direct transcriptional signatures of inflammatory cytokines, we profiled all immunologic cell types by RNAseq after systemic exposure to IL1β, IL6, and TNFα. Our results revealed a significant overlap in the responses, with broad divergence between myeloid and lymphoid cells, but with very few cell-type-specific responses. Pathway and motif analysis identified several main controllers (NF-κB, IRF8, and PU.1), but the largest portion of the response appears to be mediated by MYC, which was also implicated in the response to γc cytokines. Indeed, inflammatory and γc cytokines elicited surprisingly similar responses (∼50% overlap in NK cells). Significant overlap with interferon-induced responses was observed, paradoxically in lymphoid but not myeloid cell types. These results point to a highly redundant cytokine network, with intertwined effects between disparate cytokines and cell types."

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the meningeal immune system has recently burgeoned, particularly regarding how innate and adaptive effector cells are mobilized to meet brain challenges. However, information on how meningeal immunocytes guard brain homeostasis in healthy individuals remains limited. This study highlights the heterogeneous, polyfunctional regulatory T cell (Treg) compartment in the meninges. A Treg subtype specialized in controlling interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) responses and another dedicated to regulating follicular B cell responses were substantial components of this compartment. Accordingly, punctual Treg ablation rapidly unleashed IFN-γ production by meningeal lymphocytes, unlocked access to the brain parenchyma, and altered meningeal B cell profiles. Distally, the hippocampus assumed a reactive state, with morphological and transcriptional changes in multiple glial cell types. Within the dentate gyrus, neural stem cells underwent more death and were blocked from further differentiation, which coincided with impairments in short-term spatial-reference memory. Thus, meningeal Tregs are a multifaceted safeguard of brain homeostasis at steady state."

Purpose To investigate the association between BMI-defined obesity and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent curative resection, with a specific focus on the status of skeletal muscle assessed at CT. Materials and Methods This retrospective study investigated Korean patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent curative resection between January 2008 and December 2019. Patients were classified into nonobese (BMI <25) or obese (BMI ≥25) groups. Skeletal muscle status was assessed at CT at the level of the third lumbar vertebrae. Low skeletal muscle mass (LSMM) was defined as the sex-specific lowest quartile. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations of BMI and muscle status with overall survival. Results A total of 7076 patients (mean age, 62.5 years ± 9.7 [SD]; 4081 male) were included, of whom 2512 (35.5%) had a BMI greater than or equal to 25 (obese group). In the setting of absent LSMM and myosteatosis, patients in the obese group had longer overall survival compared with patients in the nonobese group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.90; P = .001). The associations between obesity and lower mortality were observed only in male patients (HR, 0.72; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.85; P < .001) and patients who had ever smoked (HR, 0.71; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.85; P < .001) who were without LSMM and myosteatosis, with effect differing according to sex and smoking status (P value range, <.001 to .02 for interaction). Conclusion Obesity is associated with improved overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer after curative resection when skeletal muscle mass and radiodensity are preserved. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

All patients received supportive care as determined by investigators. Patients in the placebo group, if prescribed, received 32 mg of methylprednisolone, while patients in the larsucosterol groups received matching placebo capsules. The primary end point was 90-day mortality or liver transplant (LT) rate. The key secondary end point was 90-day mortality. We prespecified the reporting of U.S. results separately.\nResults: Among 307 enrolled patients, 301 received at least one treatment dose. The difference in 90-day mortality or LT between the 30-mg or 90-mg larsucosterol and placebo groups did not reach statistical significance. Ninety-day mortality in the placebo and the 30-mg and 90-mg groups was 25 out of 103, 15 out of 102, and 17 out of 102, respectively. Among U.S. patients (76% of all enrolled patients), there were 21 deaths and 4 LTs among 77 patients in the placebo group, 8 deaths and 5 LTs among 73 patients in the 30-mg larsucosterol group, and 10 deaths and 8 LTs among 77 patients in the 90-mg larsucosterol group. In patients who were treated within less than 10 days of hospitalization (75%), mortality in the placebo group was 20 out of 79 (U.S. patients 17/57), mortality in the 30-mg larsucosterol group was 7 out of 74 (U.S. patients 4/57), and mortality in the 90-mg larsucosterol group was 13 out of 77 (U.S. patients 9/66). Most adverse events arising during treatment were attributable to hepatic disease, and there was no imbalance in adverse events that could not be ascribed to liver disease.\nConclusions: The trial did not meet the primary end point of showing a beneficial effect of larsucosterol on 90-day mortality or LT in patients with severe AH. Equipoise has been established for a further trial of larsucosterol on AH survival. (The trial was funded by the DURECT Corporation; its ClinicalTrials.gov number is NCT04563026.)."

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) exhibits an impressive ability to adapt to rapidly changing environments, despite its genome's apparent stability. Recently, phase variation through indel formation in homopolymeric tracts (HT) has emerged as a potentially important mechanism promoting adaptation in Mtb. This study examines the impact of common phase variants associated with the ESX-1 type VII secretion system, focusing on a highly variable HT upstream of the ESX-1 regulatory factor, espR. By engineering this frequently observed indel into an isogenic background, we demonstrate that a single nucleotide insertion in the espR 5'UTR causes post-transcriptional upregulation of EspR protein abundance and corresponding alterations in the EspR regulon. Consequently, this mutation increases the expression of ESX-1 components in the espACD operon and enhances ESX-1 substrate secretion. We find that this indel specifically increases isoniazid resistance without impacting the effectiveness of other drugs tested. Furthermore, we show that two distinct observed HT indels that regulate either espR translation or espACD transcription increase bacterial fitness in a mouse infection model. The presence of multiple ESX-1-associated HTs provides a mechanism to combinatorially tune protein secretion, drug sensitivity, and host-pathogen interactions. More broadly, these findings support emerging data that Mtb utilizes HT-mediated phase variation to direct genetic variation to certain sites across the genome in order to adapt to changing pressures.\nImportance: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is responsible for more deaths worldwide than any other single infectious agent. Understanding how this pathogen adapts to the varied environmental pressures imposed by host immunity and antibiotics has important implications for the design of more effective therapies. In this work, we show that the genome of Mtb contains multiple contingency loci that control the activity of the ESX-1 secretion system, which is critical for interactions with the host. These loci consist of homopolymeric DNA tracts in gene regulatory regions that are subject to high-frequency reversible variation and act to tune the activity of ESX-1. We find that variation at these sites increases the fitness of Mtb in the presence of antibiotic and/or during infection. These findings indicate that Mtb has the ability to diversify its genome in specific sites to create subpopulations of cells that are preadapted to new conditions."

    "abstract": "In Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, differential gene expression is primarily governed by the alternative sigma factor RpoS (σS). Understanding the regulation of RpoS is crucial for elucidating how B. burgdorferi is maintained throughout its enzootic cycle. Our recent studies have shown that the homolog of Fur/PerR repressor/activator BosR functions as an RNA-binding protein that controls the rpoS mRNA stability. However, the mechanisms regulating BosR, particularly in response to host signals and environmental cues, remain largely unclear. In this study, we uncovered a positive feedback loop between RpoS and BosR, wherein RpoS post-transcriptionally regulates BosR levels. Specifically, mutation or deletion of rpoS significantly reduced BosR levels, whereas artificial induction of rpoS resulted in a dose-dependent increase in BosR levels. Notably, RpoS does not affect bosR mRNA levels but instead modulates the turnover rate of the BosR protein. Moreover, we demonstrated that environmental cues do not directly influence bosR expression but instead induce rpoS transcription and RpoS production, thereby enhancing BosR protein levels. These findings reveal a new layer of complexity in the RpoN-RpoS regulatory pathway, challenging the existing paradigm and suggesting a need to re-evaluate the factors and signals previously implicated in regulating RpoS via BosR. This study provides new insights into the intricate regulatory networks underpinning B. burgdorferi's adaptation and survival in its enzootic cycle.IMPORTANCELyme disease is the most prevalent arthropod-borne infection in the United States. The etiological agent, Borreliella (or Borrelia) burgdorferi, is maintained in nature through an enzootic cycle involving a tick vector and a mammalian host. RpoS, the master regulator of differential gene expression, plays a crucial role in tick transmission and mammalian infection of B. burgdorferi. This study reveals a positive feedback loop between RpoS and a Fur/PerR homolog. Elucidating this regulatory network is essential for identifying potential therapeutic targets to disrupt B. burgdorferi's enzootic cycle. The findings also have broader implications for understanding the regulation of RpoS and Fur/PerR family in other bacteria."

While body mass index (BMI) is the most common anthropometric measure, a measure of central adiposity-the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR)-focuses on body fat content and distribution; is not distorted by bone or muscle mass, sex, or ethnicity; and may be particularly relevant in HFpEF.\nMethods: The PARAGON-HF trial randomized 4796 patients with heart failure and ejection fraction ≥45% to valsartan or sacubitril/valsartan. The current work characterizes the association of BMI and WHtR with clinical features, outcomes, and the response to neprilysin inhibition.\nResults: About half (49%) of the participants were considered obese by BMI (≥30 kg/m2), but nearly every patient (96%) had central adiposity (WHtR ≥0.5). Among patients who were not obese (BMI <30 kg/m2), 860 (37%) had marked central adiposity (WHtR ≥0.6). Higher BMI and WHtR were both associated with higher risk of total heart failure hospitalizations, but as compared with BMI, WHtR was linearly associated with heart failure outcomes and identified a higher proportion of patients who had a particularly elevated risk (i.e., 30% or greater). An obesity-survival paradox (i.e., improved outcomes in those with greater adiposity) was apparent with BMI in unadjusted analyses, but it was not observed with WHtR. Although neprilysin inhibition appeared to have greater effects on heart failure outcomes in patients with higher BMI and WHtR, analyses of interaction with obesity metrics did not show significant heterogeneity across the range of values for adiposity.\nConclusions: In PARAGON-HF, in contrast with BMI, nearly every patient with HFpEF had central adiposity (as assessed by WHtR), and the risks of adverse heart failure events were more robustly related to WHtR. These data challenge the current reliance on BMI as an appropriate metric of adiposity, and they suggest that-rather than obesity-related HFpEF being regarded as a select HFpEF subgroup-central adiposity is a ubiquitous feature of HFpEF."

In the current study, 114 patients with MPN harboring TP53MUT (VAF ≥ 2%) were evaluated for overall survival (OS), calculated from the time of TP53MUT detection: chronic phase myelofibrosis (MF-CP; N = 61); blast-phase (MPN-BP; N = 31) or accelerated-phase (MPN-AP; N = 16) MPN, and polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia (PV/ET; N = 6). Sixty-five (57%) patients harbored International Consensus Classification (ICC)-defined multihit TP53MUT and 56 (49%) monosomal/complex karyotype (MK/CK). Majority of MPN-BP (90%) and MPN-AP (81%) while 39% of MF-CP and none of PV/ET patients harbored multihit TP53MUT. OS in MPN-BP and MPN-AP was equally dismal (median 6 vs. 4.5 months, respectively; p = 1.0), regardless of multihit configuration (p = 0.44), while OS in TP53MUT MPN-BP/AP (N = 47; median 4 months) was inferior to that of a separate cohort (N = 49) with TP53 wild-type MPN-BP/AP (median 11 months; p < 0.01). OS in MF-CP was significantly shorter with multihit versus non-multihit TP53MUT (median 10 vs. 35 months; HR 2.9; p < 0.01), independent of other MF-relevant genetic risk factors, including ASXL1/SRSF2/U2AF1 mutations. Multihit TP53MUT was also associated with inferior survival following allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT): median 9 months versus \"not reached\" in patients with (N = 9) versus without (N = 8) multihit TP53MUT (p < 0.01). The presence of multihit or non-multihit TP53MUT in MPN-BP/AP or multihit TP53MUT in MF-CP is associated with exceptionally poor prognosis and justifies inclusion into the ICC category of \"myeloid neoplasms with mutated TP53.\" By contrast, detection of non-multihit TP53MUT, by itself, might not endanger short-term survival in MF-CP, PV, or ET."

    "abstract": "Background: Sarcopenia, characterized by a gradual decline in skeletal muscle mass and function with age, significantly impacts both quality of life and mortality. Autophagy plays a crucial role in maintaining muscle health. There is growing interest in leveraging autophagy to mitigate muscle ageing effects. The impact of natural autophagy activators on skeletal muscle ageing remains elusive. This study aims to identify natural autophagy activators and assess their effects on skeletal muscle ageing.\nMethods: To discover novel autophagy activators, we screened 493 natural products and identified Castanea crenata flower extract (CCFE) as a promising candidate. We investigated the effect of CCFE on cellular senescence in C2C12 cells induced by etoposide. In animal experiments, aged mice (18 months old) were fed a diet supplemented with 0.1% and 0.2% CCFE for 3 months. We assessed exercise capacity, mitochondrial function and autophagic flux to determine the impact of CCFE on skeletal muscle ageing. The components present in CCFE were analysed using LC-MS/MS, and their functional properties were examined.\nResults: CCFE enhanced autophagic flux (LC3II 80% increase, p < 0.05) and reduced senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (32.78% decrease, p < 0.001). In aged mice, a 3-month supplementation with CCFE improved muscle weight (18% increase, p < 0.05) and function (treadmill performance increased by 60%, p < 0.5; grip strength increased by 25%, p < 0.05). It alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction (basal oxygen consumption rate increased by 59%, p < 0.05) and restored autophagy. CCFE enhanced autophagy by activating AMPK (80% increase, p < 0.01) and inhibiting Atg5 protein acetylation (65% decrease, p < 0.001), with contributions from ellagic acid and polyamines. CCFE supplementation restored polyamine levels (serum spermidine increased from 0.98 ± 0.08 to 2.22 ± 0.05 μg/mL, p < 0.001) and increased urolithin levels (serum urolithin A increased from 0 to 18.79 ± 0.062 ng/mL, p < 0.001), metabolites produced by the gut microbiome from ellagic acid in aged mice.\nConclusions: CCFE effectively suppressed skeletal muscle ageing by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and restoring autophagic flux in aged mice. It achieved this by modulating AMPK and EP300 acetyltransferase activity, with contributions from its constituents, ellagic acid and polyamines. These findings highlight the potential of CCFE as a therapeutic agent for extending healthspan and mitigating sarcopenia, providing a basis for future clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Background: The cellular prion protein (PrPC), a glycoprotein encoded by the PRNP gene, is known to modulate muscle mass and exercise capacity. However, the role of PrPC in the maintenance and regeneration of skeletal muscle during ageing remains unclear.\nMethods: This study investigated the change in PrPC expression during muscle formation using C2C12 cells and evaluated muscle function in Prnp wild-type (WT) and knock-out (KO) mice at different ages (1, 9 and 15 months). To determine the role of PrPC in skeletal muscle homeostasis during ageing, we conducted regeneration experiments via cardiotoxin injection in Prnp mice to assess the effects of PrPC deficiency on the senescence of satellite stem cells (SCs) and regenerative capacity in skeletal muscle.\nResults: Our data demonstrate that PrPC expression increased significantly during muscle differentiation (p < 0.01), correlating with myogenin (immunofluorescence at the differentiation stage). PrPC deficiency disrupted muscle homeostasis, leading to age-associated mitochondrial autophagy (Pink-1, +180%, p < 0.001; Parkin, +161%, p < 0.01) and endoplasmic reticulum stress (SERCA, -26%, p < 0.05; IRE1α, +195%, p < 0.001) while decreasing the level of mitochondrial biogenesis (SIRT-1, -50%, p < 0.01; PGC-1α, -36%, p < 0.05; VDAC, -27%, p < 0.001), and activated oxidative stress (serum myoglobin, +23%, p < 0.001; MDA, +23%, p < 0.05; NFκB, +117%, p < 0.05) during ageing, which accelerated reduced muscle growth or mass accumulation (tibialis anterior muscle mass, -23%, p < 0.001; gastrocnemius muscle mass, -30%, p < 0.001; muscle fibre size, -48%, p < 0.05; MSTN, +160%, p < 0.01; MAFbx, +83%, p < 0.05). Furthermore, PrPC deficiency induced the senescence (β-galactosidase, +60%, p < 0.05; p16, +103%, p < 0.001) of SCs, which was directly related to the defect in muscle recovery, with the senescence-mediated enhancement of adipogenesis (PPARγ, +74%, p < 0.05) during the regeneration process after cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury.\nConclusions: Our findings demonstrate that PrPC is indispensable for maintaining skeletal muscle homeostasis during ageing by modulating the functional integrity of mitochondria, ER and SCs."

Due to the signal potential and targetable nature of BTK, the use of BTK inhibitors (BTKis) has been proposed for the management of several diseases. Currently, the use of BTKis is under investigations for several dermatological conditions such as pemphigus, systemic lupus erythematosus, hidradenitis suppurativa, atopic dermatitis, and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).\nAreas covered: The aim of this review is to delve into the use of BTKis in the management of CSU, in order to explore the potential of therapeutic inhibition of BTK in patients with CSU. A thorough analysis of the existing medical literature was conducted across the PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases up to 17 August 2024.\nExpert opinion: BTK use may represent a breakthrough in the management of CSU. Indeed, their use is characterized by oral administration and a favorable mechanism of action that acts on a significant pathogenic pathway rather than a single molecule. However, long-term studies are needed to further investigate safety data, although data from registered trials appear to be reassuring."

    "abstract": "Background: Sparsentan, a dual-acting antagonist for both the angiotensin II receptor type 1 and the endothelin receptor type A, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Following the publication of the PROTECT trial, sparsentan recently received approval for the treatment of IgAN in Europe. However, it remains uncertain whether an additive effect can be observed in the context of existing treatment with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, given that the PROTECT study did not investigate this dual therapy approach.\nMethods: A total of 23 patients with IgAN were treated with sparsentan via the Managed Access Programme between December 2023 and August 2024. The patients were stable on maximum tolerated doses of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and SGLT2 inhibitors, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >30 mL/min/1.73 m² and a urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) >0.75 g/g.\nResults: In the 23 patients, median (IQR) baseline eGFR (CKD-EPI) was 42 mL/min/1.73 m2 (32-63) and median baseline UPCR was 1.5 g/g (0.9-1.8). After initiation of sparsentan, UPCR significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) to a median of 0.85 g/g (0.42-1.15) in the 2-week follow-up and further declined (P = 0.001) to a median of 0.60 g/g (0.32-0.82) after 14 weeks, equivalent to a relative reduction in proteinuria up to 62% (45-74). A similar significant reduction was observed for the urine albumin/creatinine ratio. No drug-related serious adverse events were reported.\nConclusions: In this real-world setting, sparsentan shows a significant impact on proteinuria, leading to a relative reduction of 62% in UPCR after 14 weeks and beyond, even in patients already receiving SGLT2 inhibitors."

The impact of anaesthetics on postoperative biomarkers of renal injury in living kidney transplant donors is not well understood.\nPatients and methods: 70 transplant donors who underwent kidney extraction were randomly assigned to following two groups: sevoflurane (S group) and propofol (P group). Urine and blood were collected before induction and 1, 2, 6 days after operation. Kidney injury marker-1 (KIM-1), interleukin-18 (IL-18) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been developed to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although, in the last 10 years, the use of GLP-1 RAs, especially semaglutide and liraglutide, has increased, its clinical implications and how it affects metabolic parameters have yet to be fully consolidated. This narrative review explores the metabolic effects of GLP-1 RAs in weight management, blood glucose, cardiovascular health, lipid profiles, and blood pressure. Data were collected by comparing GLP-1 RAs, such as semaglutide, liraglutide, tripeptide, and exenatide, as well as comparing them to a baseline treatment group. GLP-1 RAs have shown consistent results in managing blood glucose levels by lowering HbA1c with minimal hypoglycemic risk and increasing insulin production and synthesis. GLP-1 RAs have been found to improve overall cardiovascular health and reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by improving the endothelial function of the vasculature and lowering ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) production, leading to reduced blood pressure. In addition to the cardiovascular benefits, GLP-1 RAs have a varying effect on lipid profiles, finding statistically significant results for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In conjunction with all the effects, GLP-1 RAs have been found to lower weight and aid in weight management."

    "abstract": "Background: Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is more effective in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) than other therapies, but a high proportion of patients relapse after CAR-T cell therapy owing to antigen escape, limited persistence of CAR-T cells, and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. CAR-T cell exhaustion is a major cause of relapse. Epigenetic modifications can regulate T cell activation, maturation and depletion; they can be applied to reduce T cell depletion, improve infiltration, and promote memory phenotype formation to reduce relapse after CAR-T cell therapy.\nPurpose: We propose to develop and validate in vitro the function of novel CAR-T cells for the treatment of DLBCL, which simultaneously express an anti-CD19 CAR with lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) short hairpin (sh)RNA to prevent depletion and prolong the survival of CAR-T cells.\nMethods: We designed an shRNA sequence targeting LSD1 mRNA, and created a vector with the following elements: the U6 promoter driving expression of the LSD1 shRNA sequence, the EF1a promoter driving a second-generation anti-CD19 CAR sequence encoding an anti-CD19 single-chain variable fragment (FMC63), the CD8 hinge and transmembrane structural domains, the CD28 co-stimulatory structural domain, and the CD3ζ-activating structural domain. The MFG-LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR plasmid was first constructed, then packaged in retroviral vectors and transduced into human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived T cells to generate the corresponding CAR-T cells. We examined by flow cytometry the efficiency of two CAR-T cells in killing U-2932 cells (a human DLBCL line) upon co-culture with RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells or LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells. We analyzed Ki-67 staining of the CAR-T cells by flow cytometry on days 0, 5, and 10, and counted the cells to assess expansion. We also used flow cytometry to detect the central memory T cell (TCM) proportion.\nResults: We detected the expression of the CAR in the CAR-T cells by flow cytometry, and observed transduction rates of 31.5% for RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells and 60.7% for LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells. The killing efficiency of LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells was significantly higher than that of RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells at the low effector target ratio. We further found that LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells secreted more IFN-γ and granzyme B than RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells. CAR-T cells proliferated after U-2932 cell stimulation and were able to sustain proliferation. After stimulation via U-2932 cell co-culture, both RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T and LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T populations had increased proportions of cells with the TCM phenotype, with a higher percentage among LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells.\nConclusion: We developed a novel, feasible CD19-LSD1 shRNA CAR-T cell strategy for the treatment of DLBCL. Our in vitro assay results showed that LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells more effectively killed target cells than RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells, and developed a higher proportion of TCM phenotype cells. LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells may represent a potential treatment for DLBCL."

    "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a long-term condition characterised by increased resistance to blood flow in the pulmonary circulation. The disease has a progressive course and is associated with a poor prognosis. Without treatment, PAH is associated with mortality in <3 years. Over the past decade, many advances have been made in revising the haemodynamic definition, clinical classification, risk calculation score, treatment options etc. Suggestions from the Sixth World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension were incorporated into a literature review that was included in the European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS)'s most recent iteration of their guidelines in 2022. The traditional cut-off for pulmonary hypertension (PH), i.e., mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) >25 mm Hg, has been challenged by observational cohort studies, which have shown poor outcomes for values of 21-24 mmHg; the new consensus is that PH is defined at mPAP >20 mm Hg. Although the gold standard for diagnosis and the major source of therapy guidance continues to be right cardiac catheterisation, echocardiography remains the initial test of choice. A multidisciplinary approach is highly recommended when treating PH patients and careful evaluation of patients will aid in proper diagnosis and prognosis. Pharmacotherapy for PAH has seen a paradigm shift with the successful use of newer agents in more extensive, longer and more inclusive trials driven by hard endpoints. Macitentan, selexipag and riociguat are three oral agents that have shown astounding success in PAH randomised studies in the past decade. Upfront combination therapy with two agents is now becoming the norm (following the AMBITION, OPTIMA and ITALY trials) and the momentum is shifting towards triple therapy as for essential hypertension. More recently, inhaled treprostinil was shown to improve exercise capacity in PH associated with interstitial lung disease in the phase III INCREASE study and has been granted regulatory approval for World Health Organization group 3 PH. A new class of drug, sotatercept (a tumour growth factor-β signalling inhibitor), has also been recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for management of PAH based on positive results from the phase III STELLAR study. Pulmonary artery denervation and balloon pulmonary angioplasty have emerged as viable alternatives in PH that are resistant to drug therapy. This article aims to summarise the key changes and recent advances in diagnosis and managing PH in general, with an emphasis on certain subgroups."

    "abstract": "Background: The effects of resveratrol supplementation on inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were controversial. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the changes in levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with T2DM.\nMethods: Relevant literatures before November 6, 2024 were screened through Web of Science,Embase,the Cochrane Library and other sources (ClinicalTrials, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses). The quality of the literature was evaluated according to the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews. The study quality was assessed using the risk-of-bias 2 tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Review Manager 5.3 conducted meta-analysis of the data included in the literature.\nResults: This meta-analysis was conducted in six randomized controlled trials involving 533 participants. Our results showed that supplementation with resveratrol significantly reduced C-reactive protein levels(SMD = -1.40, 95%CI(-2.60, -0.21), P = 0.02; Level of evidence: low), lipid peroxide levels (SMD = -0.99, 95%CI(-1.36, -0.61), P < 0.00001; Level of evidence: low), 8-isoprostanes(SMD = -0.79, 95%CI(-1.16, -0.42), P < 0.0001; Level of evidence: low) and oxidative stress score (SMD = -1.62, 95%CI(-2.49, -0.75), P = 0.0003; Level of evidence: very low).

However, no significant difference was observed in improving interleukin-6 levels (SMD = -1.35, 95%CI(-2.75, -0.05), P = 0.06; Level of evidence: very low), tumor necrosis factor α levels (SMD = -3.30, 95%CI(-7.47, 0.87), P = 0.12; Level of evidence: very low), superoxide dismutase levels (SMD = 0.39, 95%CI(-0.26, 1.04), P = 0.24; Level of evidence: very low), total antioxidant capacity levels (SMD = 0.39, 95%CI(-0.23, 1.00), P = 0.21; Level of evidence: very low) and malondialdehyde levels (SMD = -3.36, 95%CI(-10.30, 3.09), P = 0.29; Level of evidence: very low).\nConclusion: Resveratrol improved inflammation and oxidative stress in T2DM patients to some extent. This provides a new idea and method for clinical treatment. However, due to the limitations of the study, more large-sample, multi-center clinical studies are needed to verify this conclusion."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy has long been a cornerstone in the treatment of rare diseases and genetic disorders, offering targeted solutions to conditions once considered untreatable. As the field advances, its transformative potential is now expanding into oncology, where personalized therapies address the genetic and immune-related complexities of cancer. This review highlights innovative therapeutic strategies, including gene replacement, gene silencing, oncolytic virotherapy, CAR-T cell therapy, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, with a focus on their application in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary tool in precision medicine, enables precise editing of cancer-driving mutations, enhancing immune responses and disrupting tumor growth mechanisms. Additionally, emerging approaches target ferroptosis-a regulated, iron-dependent form of cell death-offering new possibilities for selectively inducing tumor cell death in resistant cancers. Despite significant breakthroughs, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) remain. To overcome these barriers, novel approaches like dual-targeting, armored CAR-T cells, and combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors and ferroptosis inducers are being explored. Additionally, the rise of allogeneic \"off-the-shelf\" CAR-T therapies offers scalable and more accessible treatment options. The regulatory landscape is evolving to accommodate these advancements, with frameworks like RMAT (Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy) in the U.S. and ATMP (Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products) in Europe fast-tracking the approval of gene therapies. However, ethical considerations surrounding CRISPR-based gene editing-such as off-target effects, germline editing, and ensuring equitable access-remain at the forefront, requiring ongoing ethical oversight. Advances in non-viral delivery systems, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and exosomes, are improving the safety and efficacy of gene therapies. By integrating these innovations with combination therapies and addressing regulatory and ethical concerns, gene therapy is poised to revolutionize cancer treatment, providing durable, effective, and personalized solutions for both hematologic and solid tumors."

    "abstract": "Disease overview: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most frequent type of leukemia. It typically occurs in older patients and has a highly variable clinical course. Leukemic transformation is initiated by specific genomic alterations that interfere with the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis in clonal B-cells.\nDiagnosis: The diagnosis is established by blood counts, blood smears, and immunophenotyping of circulating B-lymphocytes, which identify a clonal B-cell population carrying the CD5 antigen as well as typical B-cell markers.\nPrognosis and staging: Two clinical staging systems, Rai and Binet, provide prognostic information by using the results of physical examination and blood counts. Various biological and genetic markers provide additional prognostic information. Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del(17p)) and/or mutations of the TP53 gene predict a shorter time to progression with most targeted therapies. The CLL international prognostic index (CLL-IPI) integrates genetic, biological, and clinical variables to identify distinct risk groups of patients with CLL. The CLL-IPI retains its significance in the era of targeted agents, but the overall prognosis of CLL patients with high-risk stages has improved.\nTherapy: Only patients with active or symptomatic disease or with advanced Binet or Rai stages require therapy. When treatment is indicated, several therapeutic options exist: combinations of the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax with obinutuzumab, or venetoclax with ibrutinib, or monotherapy with one of the inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). At relapse, the initial treatment may be repeated if the treatment-free interval exceeds 3 years. If the leukemia relapses earlier, therapy should be changed using an alternative regimen.\nFuture challenges: Combinations of targeted agents now provide efficient therapies with a fixed duration that generate deep and durable remissions. These fixed-duration therapies have gained territory in the management of CLL, as they are cost-effective, avoid the emergence of resistance, and offer treatment free time to the patient. The cure rate of these novel combination regimens is unknown. Moreover, the optimal sequencing of targeted therapies remains to be determined. A medical challenge is to treat patients who are double-refractory to both BTK and BCL2 inhibitors. These patients need to be treated within experimental protocols using novel drugs."

We previously showed that the chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1)-driven nuclear export pathway is abnormally enhanced in patient-derived fibroblasts, due to overexpression of CRM1. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of CRM1 using leptomycin B rescues the senescent phenotype of HGPS fibroblasts, delineating CRM1 as a potential therapeutic target against HGPS. As a proof of concept, we analyzed the beneficial effects of pharmacologically modulating CRM1 in dermal fibroblasts from HGPS patients and the LMNAG609G/G609G mouse, using the first-in-class selective inhibitor of CRM1 termed selinexor. Remarkably, treatment of HGPS fibroblasts with selinexor mitigated senescence and promoted progerin clearance via autophagy, while at the transcriptional level restored the expression of numerous differentially-expressed genes and rescued cellular processes linked to aging. In vivo, oral administration of selinexor to the progeric mouse resulted in decreased progerin immunostaining in the liver and aorta, decreased progerin levels in most liver, lung and kidney samples analyzed by immunoblotting, and improved aortic histopathology. Collectively our data indicate that selinexor exerts its geroprotective action by at least two mechanisms: normalizing the nucleocytoplasmic partition of proteins with a downstream effect on the aging-associated transcriptome and decreasing progerin levels. Further investigation of the overall effect of selinexor on LmnaG609G/G609G mouse physiology, with emphasis in cardiovascular function is warranted, to determine its therapeutic utility for HGPS and aging-associated disorders characterized by CRM1 overactivity."

    "abstract": "Deposition of abnormally phosphorylated tau aggregates is a central event leading to neuronal dysfunction and death in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Among tau aggregates, oligomers (TauOs) are considered the most toxic. AD brains show significant increase in TauOs compared to healthy controls, their concentration correlating with the severity of cognitive deficits and disease progression. In vitro and in vivo neuronal TauO exposure leads to synaptic and cognitive dysfunction, but their mechanisms of action are unclear. Evidence suggests that the cellular prion protein (PrPC) may act as a mediator of TauO neurotoxicity, as previously proposed for β-amyloid and α-synuclein oligomers. To investigate whether PrPC mediates TauO detrimental activities, we compared their effects on memory and synaptic plasticity in wild type (WT) and PrPC knockout (Prnp0/0) mice. Intracerebroventricular injection of TauOs significantly impaired recognition memory in WT but not in Prnp0/0 mice. Similarly, TauOs inhibited long-term potentiation in acute hippocampal slices from WT but not Prnp0/0 mice. Surface plasmon resonance indicated a high-affinity binding between TauOs and PrPC with a KD of 20-50 nM. Immunofluorescence analysis of naïve and PrPC-overexpressing HEK293 cells exposed to TauOs showed a PrPC dose-dependent association of TauOs with cells over time, and their co-localization with PrPC on the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments, suggesting PrPC-may play a role in TauO internalization. These findings support the concept that PrPC mediates the detrimental activities of TauOs through a direct interaction, suggesting that targeting this interaction might be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD and other tauopathies."

    "abstract": "Background: Oxidative stress is key in inflammatory airway diseases. Heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) regulates oxidative stress, but its role in airway diseases needs exploration.\nMethods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy nasal mucosa and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) were identified from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Candidate genes were further screened using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. Causal inference between candidate genes and upper and lower airway diseases (CRSwNP, allergic rhinitis (AR), and asthma (AS)) was conducted using bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (TwoSampleMR) analysis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were used to determine the cellular localization and intercellular interactions of candidate genes. Molecular docking was used to identify potential therapeutic agents.\nResults: HMOX1 expression was significantly elevated in CRSwNP. TwoSampleMR analysis indicated a negative causal relationship between HMOX1 exposure and the occurrence of upper and lower airway diseases (CRSwNP [(odds ratio (OR)/95% confidence interval (CI): 0.945/(0.893-0.999), P = 0.044], AR [OR/95% CI: 0.997/(0.994-0.999), P = 0.007], and AS [OR/95% CI: 0.935/(0.895-0.977), P = 0.003]). scRNA-seq data revealed HMOX1 localization in M2 macrophages. Molecular docking identified 15 antioxidants, including Acetylcysteine and Quercetin, that can upregulate HMOX1 expression.\nConclusion: HMOX1 may have a protective role in the pathogenesis of upper and lower airway diseases (CRSwNP, AR, and AS) by modulating oxidative stress. Antioxidants that increase HMOX1 expression could offer new therapeutic avenues for these diseases.\nClinical trial: Not applicable."

    "abstract": "Background: The increasing societal emphasis on physical appearance, particularly influenced by social media, has led to a significant rise in demand for aesthetic dentistry procedures. This study aims to explore the ethical dimensions of marketing practices and the phenomenon of overtreatment in cosmetic dental procedures, highlighting the implications for patient care and professional integrity.\nMethods: A systematic literature review was conducted across four databases, yielding an initial 76 articles. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 12 articles were selected for analysis. The review focused on ethical considerations, marketing practices, and overtreatment in aesthetic dentistry, employing narrative synthesis to extract relevant data.\nResults: The findings indicate that social media is a primary driver of patient expectations, often prioritizing aesthetic outcomes over health considerations. This trend raises ethical concerns about informed consent and autonomy. The commodification of dental care, fueled by aggressive marketing strategies, has resulted in a notable increase in overtreatment, where unnecessary procedures are performed to satisfy commercial pressures and idealized beauty standards. The review highlights a lack of robust ethical guidelines governing marketing practices in aesthetic dentistry, exacerbating these issues.\nConclusions: The study underscores the urgent need for clear ethical frameworks to guide dental practitioners in balancing patient welfare with business interests. Recommendations include the implementation of ethics education in dental curricula, the development of comprehensive ethical guidelines, and fostering open communication between practitioners and patients. These measures are essential for enhancing informed decision-making and ensure that patient care remains the priority in aesthetic dentistry."

However, whether diabetes affects TyG-cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is still unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the TyG index and CVD risk, stratified by diabetes status, as well as the potential modifying effect of diabetic status.\nMethods/design: The PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were searched for studies on the associations between the TyG index and cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with and without diabetes from inception to December 2, 2024. The random effects model was employed to pool the effect sizes.\nResults: A total of 50 cohort studies (7,239,790 participants) were included. The mean age of participants was 31.46 years (diabetes mellitus [DM]: 65.18; non-DM: 31.23), and 40.66% of participants were female (DM: 36.07%; non-DM: 40.70%). The associations between the TyG index and cardiovascular events (HR: 1.72 vs. 1.55, P = 0.55), major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (HR: 2.02 vs. 1.91, P = 0.84), stroke (HR: 1.46 vs. 1.39, P = 0.77) and cardiovascular death (HR: 1.85 vs. 1.60, P = 0.56) were similar among DM and non-DM individuals. However, the associations between the TyG index and ischemic heart disease (IHD) (HR: 2.20 vs. 1.57, P = 0.03) as well as all-cause mortality (HR: 1.94 vs. 1.24, P = 0.01) were stronger in DM patients than in non-DM patients.\nConclusion: TyG index showed association with cardiovascular events, mortality, and all-cause mortality independent of diabetic status, with low to moderate certainty. The associations for IHD and all-cause death were stronger in diabetic patients than in individuals without diabetes. Future studies should explore the role of diabetes in the TyG index-associated CVD outcomes and mortality."

Seminal clinicopathological series highlighted that a relevant number of patients alive-diagnosed with idiopathic PD have an alternative post-mortem diagnosis. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PD comparing the in-vivo clinical diagnosis with the post-mortem diagnosis performed through the pathological examination in 2 groups.\nMethods: In this retrospective case-control study, patients and healthy subjects who consented to the post-mortem pathological diagnosis at the UK Brain Bank were consecutively enrolled from the UK Brain Bank. Medical records were reviewed to classify participants and performance metrics were further calculated using neuropathological diagnosis as the gold standard.\nResults: Four thousand five hundred seventy one subjects were eligible for the study. The clinical diagnosis group was: 1,048 Parkinson's patients and 1,242 healthy subjects. Pathology diagnosis group were: 996 Parkinson's patients and 1,288 subjects with no post-mortem abnormality. For the group of clinical diagnosis, PD diagnosis showed: sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 86%, accuracy of 90.96%, F1-Score 0.89, and a receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (ROC AUC) 0.925 (SE ± 0.006) [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.913, 0.937], 𝑝<0.001. In this group, the most frequent pathology diagnosis among clinically misdiagnosed PD (false positive) patients was dementia with Lewy bodies (19.4%). Conversely, the most frequent clinical diagnosis among PD missed clinical diagnosis (false negative) patients was Alzheimer's disease (18.5%).\nInterpretation: Our findings confirm a still significant diagnostic error and emphasize the need for more fine and homogeneous criteria to classify idiopathic Parkinson's patients correctly.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused global pandemonium, and due to an unprecedented global response, the popularity and use of (veterinary) ivermectin, amongst many other conceivable 'treatments', experienced a meteoric rise. Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone compound belonging to the avermectin drug class and is a registered medicine in many countries, although the most common use is as veterinary medicine. In this study, a fast HPLC method was developed and validated for the quantification of ivermectin in veterinary products that were used off-label by a substantial number of people during COVID-19. Locally used veterinary products were collected as well as commercial products acquired and were tested using the newly developed method. The ivermectin content was compared to the products' label claims and it was found that all products tested contained ivermectin within acceptable limits. However, the use of veterinary products is strongly discouraged due to high dosages and administration regimens that were tested in animals and can lead to serious adverse events in humans. The presence of untested excipients and secondary actives, such as clorsulon, which can cause unknown (long-term) health impacts in humans, further adds credence to this warning."

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bone resorption represents a pathological condition marked by an increase in bone loss, commonly associated with chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. Current therapies primarily focus on anti-inflammatory drugs and bisphosphonates; however, these treatments are limited due to side effects, inadequate efficacy, and unpredictable long-term complications. Kurarinone (KR), a bioactive compound isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Sophora flavescens, exhibits a range of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and cardiovascular protective effects. To address the limitations of existing therapies and enhance drug utilization, this study explores the potential of KR as a therapeutic agent for inflammatory bone resorption and delineates its underlying mechanisms. In vitro experiments reveal that KR notably inhibits osteoclastogenesis and reduces the expression of osteoclastic markers. Additionally, KR decreases the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, while downregulating NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) to diminish ROS production. Furthermore, KR activates the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which enhances the activity of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and catalase (CAT), facilitating the clearance of excess ROS. The compound also hinders osteoclast formation and functionality by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway. Lentiviral knockdown of CAT can partially reverse these effects of KR. Meanwhile, in vivo experiments indicate that KR effectively mitigates bone loss in an LPS-induced inflammatory bone resorption model. In summary, KR is a promising new star in breaking through the limitations of previous drugs and treating inflammatory bone resorption."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is an important cause of female infertility, stemming from follicle dysfunction or premature oocyte depletion. Pathogenic variants in genes such as NOBOX, GDF9, BMP15, and FSHR have been linked to POI. NOBOX, a transcription factor expressed in oocytes and granulosa cells, plays a pivotal role in folliculogenesis. Loss-of-function variants in NOBOX are reported in 1-2% of POI women. This study aims to describe the association of novel NOBOX variants with a distinct oocyte, zygote, and embryo maturation arrest (OZEMA) phenotype in infertile women.\nMethods: Three unrelated women experiencing OZEMA and undergoing multiple in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles present with a germline NOBOX variant. The detected variants were cross-referenced with a large genetic database to explore their association with IVF outcomes.\nResults: A heterozygous NM_001080413.3 (NOBOX): c.1797_1798del, p.(Cys600Phefs*27) variant was detected in a woman with oocyte maturation arrest. Another heterozygous variant, NM_001080413.3 (NOBOX): c.1849C > T, p.(His617Tyr), was detected in two women experiencing embryonic developmental arrest. Segregation analysis in one of the two latter families revealed the presence of the p.(His617Tyr) variant in an affected sister, while the two fertile sisters did not carry this variant. Furthermore, the p.(His617Tyr) variant was found in three women in a large database of whom two presented with an embryonic developmental arrest.\nConclusion: Two heterozygous NOBOX variants were identified in women with an OZEMA phenotype. Where pathogenic NOBOX variants are typically linked to POI, our clinical findings suggest that NOBOX plays a role in subsequent oocyte maturation and early embryo development."

However, kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are at high risk for bone disorders, particularly low bone turnover disease, which increases fracture risk. Teriparatide, an anabolic agent, may provide a beneficial treatment option for these patients.\nMaterials and methods: This single-center, retrospective observational study involved 18 KTRs with osteoporosis, low bone turnover, and a history of vertebral or non-vertebral fractures. Patients received teriparatide (20 μg/day) for up to 2 years. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the lumbar spine (LS), total hip (TH), femoral neck (FN), and trabecular bone score (TBS) were measured at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years. In addition, bone turnover markers (BTMs), serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and kidney function were monitored.\nResults: Significant increases in LS aBMD were observed after 1 year (0.941 ± 0.152 vs 1.043 ± 0.165, p = 0.04) and maintained after 2 years compared to baseline (0.941 ± 0.152 vs 1.074 ± 0.154, p = 0.03). TH aBMD significantly increased after 2 years (0.753 ± 0.145 vs 0.864 ± 0.141, p = 0.04), while FN and TBS showed non-significant improvement. Teriparatide was well-tolerated, with mild and transient hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia.\nConclusion: Teriparatide significantly improved BMD at the LS and TH in KTRs with osteoporosis and low bone turnover, showing a favorable safety profile."

    "abstract": "Background: Marathon training and running have many beneficial effects on human health and physical fitness; however, they also pose risks. To date, no comprehensive review regarding both the benefits and risks of marathon running on different organ systems has been published.\nMain body: The aim of this review was to provide a comprehensive review of the benefits and risks of marathon training and racing on different organ systems. A predefined search strategy including keywords (e.g., marathon, cardiovascular system, etc.) and free text search was used. Articles covering running regardless of sex, age, performance level, and event type (e.g., road races, mountain marathons) were considered, whereas articles examining only cycling, triathlon, stress-tests or other sports were excluded. In total, we found 1021 articles in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, of which 329 studies were included in this review. Overall, marathon training offers several benefits for different organ systems and reduces all-cause mortality. As such, it improves cardiovascular risk factors, leads to favorable cardiac adaptations, enhances lung function, and improves quality of life in chronic kidney disease patients. It also enhances gastrointestinal mobility and reduces the risk of specific tumors such as colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Marathon training enhances bone health and skeletal muscle metabolism. It further positively affects hematopoiesis and cytotoxic abilities of natural killer cells, and may act neuroprotective on a long-term basis. After a marathon, changes in biomarkers suggesting pathological events in certain organ systems such as cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, liver, hematological, immune, musculoskeletal, central nervous, and endocrine systems can often be observed. Mostly, these changes are limited to 1-3 days post-race and usually normalize within a week. Moreover, marathon running poses the risk of serious adverse events such as sudden cardiac death or acute liver failure. Concerning lung function, a decrease after a marathon race was observed. Acute kidney injury, as well as electrolyte imbalances, are relatively common amongst marathon finishers. Many runners complain of gastrointestinal symptoms during or after long-distance running. Many runners suffer from running-related musculoskeletal injuries often impairing performance. A marathon is often accompanied by an acute inflammatory response with transient immunosuppression, making runners susceptible to infections. Also, hormonal alterations such as increased cortisol levels or decreased testosterone levels immediately after a race are observed. Disturbances in sleep patterns are commonly found in marathon runners leading up to or directly after the race.\nConclusion: All in all, marathon training is generally safe for human health and individual organ systems. Considering the high popularity of marathon running, these findings supply athletes, coaches, sports scientists, and sports medicine practitioners with practical applications. Further large-scale studies examining long-term effects on the cardiovascular, renal, and other system are needed."

    "abstract": "Cognitive resilience (CR) describes the phenomenon of individuals evading cognitive decline despite prominent Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. Operationalization and measurement of this latent construct is non-trivial as it cannot be directly observed. The residual approach has been widely applied to estimate CR, where the degree of resilience is estimated through a linear model's residuals. We demonstrate that this approach makes specific, uncontrollable assumptions and likely leads to biased and erroneous resilience estimates. This is especially true when information about CR is contained in the data the linear model was fitted to, either through inclusion of CR-associated variables or due to correlation. We propose an alternative strategy which overcomes the standard approach's limitations using machine learning principles. Our proposed approach makes fewer assumptions about the data and CR and achieves better estimation accuracy on simulated ground-truth data."

    "abstract": "Activation of Ca2+ channels in Ca2+ stores in organelles and the plasma membrane generates cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]c) signals that control almost every aspect of cell function, including metabolism, vesicle fusion and contraction. Mitochondria have a high capacity for Ca2+ uptake and chelation, alongside efficient Ca2+ release mechanisms. Still, mitochondria do not store Ca2+ in a prolonged manner under physiological conditions and lack the capacity to generate global [Ca2+]c signals. However, mitochondria take up Ca2+ at high local [Ca2+]c signals that originate from neighbouring organelles, and also during sustained global elevations of [Ca2+]c. Accumulated Ca2+ in the mitochondria stimulates oxidative metabolism and upon return to the cytoplasm, can produce spatially confined rises in [Ca2+]c to exert control over processes that are sensitive to Ca2+. Thus, the mitochondrial handling of [Ca2+]c is of physiological relevance. Furthermore, dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ handling can contribute to debilitating diseases. We discuss the mechanisms and relevance of mitochondria in local and global calcium signals."

Alterations in the gut microbiome composition as observed in inflammatory bowel diseases can modulate brain function and emerging empirical evidence has indicated that interactions among the brain-gut microbiome-axis seem to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of both inflammatory bowel diseases and psychiatric disorders and their comorbidity. Yet, the immunological and molecular mechanisms underlying the co-occurrence of inflammatory bowel diseases and psychological symptoms are still poorly understood. The aim of this narrative review is to highlight contemporary empirical findings supporting a pivotal role of the gut microbiome in the pathophysiology of highly prevalent neuropsychiatric symptoms in inflammatory bowel diseases such as fatigue, depression, and anxiety. Finally, we focus on microbiome modulation as potential treatment option for comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms in immune-mediated diseases and especially in inflammatory bowel diseases. High-quality clinical trials are required to clarify how microbiome modulation through dietary interventions or probiotic, prebiotic or synbiotic treatment can be used clinically to improve mental health and thus quality of life of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."

    "abstract": "To synthesize available evidence on predictive factors associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares during pregnancy, we systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library through January 2024 for observational studies on risk and protective factors of SLE flares during pregnancy. Odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD), as well as their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to quantify effect sizes. We employed fixed-effect or random-effect models based on heterogeneity assessments (I2 statistics). Sensitivity analyses were performed using the leave-one-out method, and publication bias was assessed through Egger's test. Thirty-two studies were included in the meta-analysis. Significant baseline SLE characteristics associated with higher risks for flares during pregnancy were identified: thrombocytopenia (with OR [95%CI], 2.29 [1.14-4.58]), hypocomplementemia (1.70 [1.28-2.27]), anti-dsDNA positivity (1.43 [1.16-1.77]), and a history of lupus nephritis (2.34 [1.70-3.21]). Protective factors included achieving remission before pregnancy (0.32 [0.20-0.49]) and antimalarial use at baseline (0.71 [0.55-0.92]) and during pregnancy (0.44 [0.33-0.58]). Additional risk factors included baseline glucocorticoid usage (1.51 [1.17-1.94]), glucocorticoid administration during pregnancy (3.39 [1.90-6.06]), use of other immunosuppressive drugs at baseline (1.46 [1.00-2.12]), and hypertension (2.16 [1.45-3.23]). Furthermore, individuals in the flare group were younger, had higher baseline disease activity, and lower C3/C4 levels compared to the non-flare group. This study highlighted the critical role of managing SLE disease activity prior to pregnancy to minimize flare risks, and identified significant risk and protective factors associated with flares. These evidences facilitate better clinical management strategies for pregnant women with SLE. Key Points • Synthesizes existing evidence on the risk and protective factors associated with SLE flares during pregnancy. • Highlights the critical importance of effectively managing disease activity prior to conception. • Provides insights to enhance risk stratification and management strategies for pregnancies in patients with SLE."

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a critical organ in maintaining homoeostasis against metabolic stress, and histone post-translational modifications are pivotal in those processes. However, the intricate nature of histone methylation in skeletal muscle and its impact on metabolic homoeostasis have yet to be elucidated. Here, we report that mitochondria-rich slow-twitch myofibers are characterized by significantly higher levels of H3K36me2 along with repressed expression of Kdm2a, an enzyme that specifically catalyses H3K36me2 demethylation. Deletion or inhibition of Kdm2a shifts fuel use from glucose under cold challenge to lipids under obese conditions by increasing the proportion of mitochondria-rich slow-twitch myofibers. This protects mice against cold insults and high-fat-diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, Kdm2a deficiency leads to a marked increase in H3K36me2 levels, which then promotes the recruitment of Mrg15 to the Esrrg locus to process its precursor messenger RNA splicing, thereby reshaping skeletal muscle metabolic profiles to induce slow-twitch myofiber transition. Collectively, our data support the role of Kdm2a as a viable target against metabolic stress."

    "abstract": "Caffeine consumption is regarded as a widespread phenomenon, and its usage has continued to increase. In addition, the growing usage of antidepressants worldwide and increase in mental health disorders were shown in recent statistical analyses conducted by the World Health Organisation. The coadministration of caffeine and antidepressants remains a concern due to potential interactions that can alter a patient's response to therapy. This review investigates the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between caffeine and the five main classes of antidepressants: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and other antidepressants not categorised by class, which we have categorised as 'miscellaneous'. The interaction between fluvoxamine and caffeine resulted in increased concentrations of caffeine in the body and lowered the renal clearance of fluvoxamine. Other SSRIs such as fluoxetine and escitalopram had augmented antidepressant effects by decreasing their renal clearance and prolonging their effects in the body when coadministered with caffeine. Caffeine may also increase the concentration of paroxetine, potentially affecting its pharmacodynamic effects. TCAs such as clomipramine, imipramine, desipramine, and sertraline, were found to reduce the metabolism of caffeine. However, studies suggest caffeine had no significant effect on the concentration of these medications in blood or brain tissue. The inhibition of caffeine at high doses when used with MAOIs such as tranylcypromine and phenelzine was found to lead to a higher likelihood of experiencing hypertension. Coadministration of caffeine with venlafaxine (SNRIs) suggests minimal interactions between the two substances and the pharmacodynamic effects of venlafaxine were unlikely to be impacted by caffeine consumption. Miscellaneous antidepressants (reboxetine, mianserin, agomelatine, maprotiline, and mirtazapine) displayed varying pharmacodynamic interactions with caffeine, resulting in increased antidepressant effects where vortioxetine, maprotiline, and mirtazapine failed to demonstrate any interactions. In conclusion, caffeine demonstrated varying effects on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of each class of antidepressants, with several classes of antidepressants demonstrating a similar effect on caffeine."

    "abstract": "Two main stages are differentiated in patients with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD), one compensated (cACLD) with an excellent prognosis, and the other decompensated (dACLD), defined by the appearance of complications (ascites, variceal bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy) and associated with high mortality. Preventing the progression to dACLD might dramatically improve prognosis and reduce the burden of care associated with ACLD. Portal hypertension is a major driver of the transition from cACLD to dACLD, and a portal pressure of ≥10 mmHg defines clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) as the threshold from which decompensating events may occur. In recent years, innovative studies have provided evidence supporting new strategies to prevent decompensation in cACLD. These studies have yielded major advances, including the development of noninvasive tests (NITs) to identify patients with CSPH with reasonable confidence, the demonstration that aetiological therapies can prevent disease progression and even achieve regression of cirrhosis, and the finding that non-selective β-blockers can effectively prevent decompensation in patients with cACLD and CSPH, mainly by reducing the risk of ascites, the most frequent decompensating event. Here, we review the evidence supporting new strategies to manage cACLD to prevent decompensation and the caveats for their implementation, from patient selection using NITs to ancillary therapies."

    "abstract": "In patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), overlapping non-gastrointestinal conditions such as fibromyalgia, headaches, gynaecological and urological conditions, sleep disturbances and fatigue are common, as is overlap among DGBI in different regions of the gastrointestinal tract. These overlaps strongly influence patient management and outcome. Shared pathophysiology could explain this scenario, but details are not fully understood. This overlap has been shown to be of great relevance for DGBI. In addition, symptoms considered to be caused by a DGBI could have a detectable organic cause, and in patients with a diagnosed organic gastrointestinal disease, symptoms not clearly explained by the pathology defining this organic disease are common. Thus, the aims of this Rome Foundation Working Team Report were to review the literature on overlapping conditions among patients with paediatric and adult DGBI and, based on the available epidemiological and clinical evidence, make recommendations for the current diagnostic and therapeutic approach, and for future research. Specifically, we focused on other DGBI in the same or different gastrointestinal anatomical region(s), DGBI overlap with organic bowel diseases in remission, and DGBI overlap with non-gastrointestinal, non-structural conditions."

Current research identifies two types of mitochondria based on their contact with lipid droplets: peridroplet mitochondria (PDM) and cytoplasmic mitochondria (CM). This work aimed to investigate the alterations of CM and PDM in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) induced by spontaneous type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in db/db mice. It was found that insulin resistance increased both the number and size of lipid droplets in the liver by enhancing the accumulation of free fatty acids, which is accompanied by an increase in contacts with mitochondria. We described the different patterns of tight contacts between small lipid droplets and mitochondria in purified CM and PDM by examining their oxidation states and morphological characteristics. In CM, enhanced fatty acid oxidation resulted in elongated mitochondria that surrounded single small lipid droplets and were responsible for lipid droplet consumption, while in PDM, increased substrates for lipid synthesis promoted lipid droplet expansion with the assistance of the endoplasmic reticulum. These data show the different ways in which mitochondrial contact with lipid droplets could provide new insights for future research on liver lipid metabolism."

    "abstract": "This research aimed to describe the effect of azithromycin combined with fluticasone propionate aerosol inhalation on immune function in children with chronic cough caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infection. This study was a retrospective analysis in which 110 children with chronic cough caused by MP infection were divided into two groups based on different treatment methods: 58 cases in the control group treated with azithromycin dry suspension and 52 cases in the intervention group treated with azithromycin dry suspension and fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. Lung function, inflammatory factors, immune indicators, laboratory-related indicators, adverse reactions, and therapeutic effects were compared between the two groups. Compared with the pre-treatment period, levels of FEV1, FVC, and PEF increased post-treatment in both groups, with higher levels observed in the intervention group (all P < 0.05). IL-17, IL-6, and IL-10 levels decreased post-treatment in both groups, with the intervention group showing lower levels (all P < 0.05). The levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, CRP, ESR, and PCT decreased in both groups, with the intervention group showing lower levels (all P < 0.05). Higher treatment effectiveness rates were observed in the intervention group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions did not differ significantly between the two groups (P > 0.05).\nConclusion: Azithromycin dry suspension combined with fluticasone propionate aerosol inhalation in children with chronic cough due to MP infection reduces inflammatory factors, improves immune function, and enhances treatment efficacy.\nWhat is known: • The addition of oral azithromycin has demonstrated significant efficacy in treating cough caused by chronic respiratory disease, and inhaling fluticasone propionate has a more significant systemic impact than other corticosteroids.\nWhat is new: • Azithromycin dry suspension combined with fluticasone propionate aerosol inhalation in children with chronic cough due to MP infection reduces inflammatory factors, improves immune function, and enhances treatment efficacy."

Although genetic elements that capture and store gene cassettes in Vibrio species, called integrons, are known to play an important role in bacterial adaptation, a role in phage defence had not been defined. Here we combine bioinformatic and molecular techniques to show that the chromosomal integron of Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a hotspot for anti-phage defence genes. Using bioinformatics, we discovered that previously characterized defences localize to integrons. Intrigued by this discovery, we cloned 57 integron gene cassettes and identified 9 previously unrecognized systems that mediate defence. Our work reveals that integrons are an important reservoir of defence systems in V. parahaemolyticus. As integrons are of ancient origin and are widely distributed among Proteobacteria, these results provide an approach for the discovery of anti-phage defence systems across a broad range of bacteria."

Spatial omics approaches have enabled the study of these layers in tissue context but are often limited to one or two modalities, offering an incomplete view of cellular identity. Here we present spatial-Mux-seq, a multimodal spatial technology that allows simultaneous profiling of five different modalities: two histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, whole transcriptome and a panel of proteins at tissue scale and cellular level in a spatially resolved manner. We applied this technology to mouse embryos and mouse brains, generating detailed multimodal tissue maps that identified more cell types and states compared to unimodal data. This analysis uncovered spatiotemporal relationships among histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, gene expression and protein levels during neuron differentiation, and revealed a radial glia niche with spatially dynamic epigenetic signals. Collectively, the spatial multi-omics approach heralds a new era for characterizing tissue and cellular heterogeneity that single-modality studies alone could not reveal."

Here we present the first unbiased morphology-based genome-wide perturbation atlas in human cells, containing three genome-wide genotype-phenotype maps comprising CRISPR-Cas9-based knockouts of >20,000 genes in >30 million cells. Our optical pooled cell profiling platform (PERISCOPE) combines a destainable high-dimensional phenotyping panel (based on Cell Painting) with optical sequencing of molecular barcodes and a scalable open-source analysis pipeline to facilitate massively parallel screening of pooled perturbation libraries. This perturbation atlas comprises high-dimensional phenotypic profiles of individual cells with sufficient resolution to cluster thousands of human genes, reconstruct known pathways and protein-protein interaction networks, interrogate subcellular processes and identify culture media-specific responses. Using this atlas, we identify the poorly characterized disease-associated TMEM251/LYSET as a Golgi-resident transmembrane protein essential for mannose-6-phosphate-dependent trafficking of lysosomal enzymes.

This study aimed to explore the functional roles of ubiquitination-related genes in CD. Differentially expressed ubiquitination-related genes were identified by intersecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the GSE95095 dataset in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with a set of ubiquitination-related genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed. Key genes were selected by combining hub genes from the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network with feature genes identified by Lasso and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. Additionally, the correlation between key genes and immune infiltration was assessed, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of key genes was conducted. The efficacy of key genes was validated using ROC curves in an external dataset, and their expression was confirmed in LPS-induced Caco-2 cells through RT-qPCR. A total of 32 ubiquitination-related DEGs were identified, and two key genes (UBE2R2, NEDD4L) were selected. The infiltration of M2 macrophages was reduced in CD patients, with UBE2R2 expression negatively correlated and NEDD4L expression positively correlated with M2 macrophage infiltration. GSEA indicated that UBE2R2 was enriched in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, regulation of autophagy, and limonene and pinene degradation, while NEDD4L was enriched in lysosome, Wnt signaling, and calcium signaling pathways. ROC curves demonstrated superior efficacy for NEDD4L. In LPS-induced Caco-2 cells, UBE2R2 expression increased, while NEDD4L expression decreased. A comprehensive analysis of the functional relationship between ubiquitination-related genes and CD can enhance understanding of CD pathogenesis and suggest potential therapeutic targets."

In this study, we leveraged the uniquely comprehensive data from the Human Phenotype Project cohort, which includes 448 sleep characteristics collected from 16,812 nights of home sleep apnea test monitoring in 6,366 adults (3,043 male and 3,323 female participants), to study associations between sleep traits and body characteristics across 16 body systems. In this analysis, which identified thousands of significant associations, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was the body characteristic that was most strongly correlated with the peripheral apnea-hypopnea index, as adjusted by sex, age and body mass index (BMI). Moreover, using sleep characteristics, we could predict over 15% of body characteristics, spanning 15 of the 16 body systems, in a held-out set of individuals. Notably, sleep characteristics contributed more to the prediction of certain insulin resistance, blood lipids (such as triglycerides) and cardiovascular measurements than to the characteristics of other body systems. This contribution was independent of VAT, as sleep characteristics outperformed age, BMI and VAT as predictors for these measurements in both male and female participants. Gut microbiome-related pathways and diet (especially for female participants) were notably predictive of clinical obstructive sleep apnea symptoms, particularly sleepiness, surpassing the prediction power of age, BMI and VAT on these symptoms. Together, lifestyle factors contributed to the prediction of over 50% of the sleep characteristics. This work lays the groundwork for exploring the associations of sleep traits with body characteristics and developing predictive models based on sleep monitoring."

The Surgical Procedures Eliminate Compensated Cirrhosis In Advancing Long-term (SPECCIAL) observational study compared the effects of metabolic surgery and nonsurgical treatment in patients with obesity and compensated histologically proven MASH-related cirrhosis. Using a doubly robust estimation methodology to balance key baseline characteristics between groups, the time-to-incident MALO was compared between 62 patients (68% female) who underwent metabolic surgery and 106 nonsurgical controls (71% female), with a mean follow-up of 10.0 ± 4.5 years. The 15 year cumulative incidence of MALO was 20.9% (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.5-35.9%) in the surgical group compared with 46.4% (95% CI, 25.6-61.3%) in the nonsurgical group, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.12-0.64), P = 0.003. The 15 year cumulative incidence of decompensated cirrhosis was 15.6% (95% CI, 0-31.3%) in the surgical group compared with 30.7% (95% CI, 12.9-44.8%) in the nonsurgical group, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.20 (95% CI, 0.06-0.68), P = 0.01. Among patients with compensated MASH-related cirrhosis and obesity, metabolic surgery, compared with nonsurgical management, was associated with a significantly lower risk of incident MALO. In the absence of approved medical therapies for compensated MASH-related cirrhosis, metabolic surgery may represent a safe and effective therapeutic option to influence the trajectory of cirrhosis."

    "abstract": "Aging is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). With the prevalence of AD increased, a mechanistic linkage between aging and the pathogenesis of AD needs to be further addressed. Here, we report that a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) modification of p53 is implicated in the process which remarkably increased in AD patient's brain. Mechanistically, SUMOylation of p53 at K386 residue causes the dissociation of SET/p53 complex, thus releasing SET into the cytoplasm, SET further interacts with cytoplasmic PP2A and inhibits its activity, resulting in tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons. In addition, SUMOylation of p53 promotes the p53 Ser15 phosphorylation that mediates neuronal senescence. Notably, p53 SUMOylation contributes to synaptic damage and cognitive defects in AD model mice. We also demonstrate that the SUMOylation inhibiter, Ginkgolic acid, recovering several senescent phenotypes drove by p53 SUMOylation in primary neurons. These findings suggest a previously undiscovered etiopathogenic relationship between aging and AD that is linked to p53 SUMOylation and the potential of SUMOylated p53-based therapeutics for neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease."

    "abstract": "Immunity suffers a function deficit during aging, and the incidence of cancer is increased in the elderly. However, most cancer models employ young mice, which are poorly representative of adult cancer patients. We have previously reported that Triple-Therapy (TT), involving antigen-presenting-cell activation by vinorelbine and generation of TCF1+-stem-cell-like T cells (scTs) by cyclophosphamide significantly improved anti-PD-1 efficacy in anti-PD1-resistant models like Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), due to T-cell-mediated tumor killing. Here, we describe the effect of TT on TNBC growth and on tumor-microenvironment (TME) of young (6-8w, representative of human puberty) versus adult (12 m, representative of 40y-humans) mice. TT-efficacy was similar in young and adults, as CD8+ scTs were only marginally reduced in adults. However, single-cell analyses revealed major differences in the TME: adults had fewer CD4+ scTs, B-naïve and NK-cells, and more memory-B-cells. Cancer-associated-fibroblasts (CAF) with an Extracellular Matrix (ECM) deposition-signature (Matrix-CAFs) were more common in young mice, while pro-inflammatory stromal populations and myofibroblasts were more represented in adults. Matrix-CAFs in adult mice displayed decreased ECM-remodeling abilities, reduced collagen deposition, and a different pattern of interactions with the other cells of the TME. Taken together, our results suggest that age-dependent differences in the TME should be considered when designing preclinical studies."

Additionally, different adipose tissues can have contrasting effects, with visceral adipose tissue being identified as particularly harmful. This study aimed to explore the relationship between the ratio of the lean mass index (LMI) to the visceral fat mass index (VFMI) and cardiometabolic disorders, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes, as previous research on this topic is lacking. This cross-sectional study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted in the United States and included 10,867 individuals. Logistic regression was employed to explore the association between LMI/VFMI and cardiometabolic disorders. Generalized additive models were utilized to examine the nonlinear relationships between variables. Data analysis revealed a consistent inverse association between ln(LMI/VFMI) and dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. Each 2.7-fold increase in LMI/VFMI (one unit of ln[LMI/VFMI]) was associated with lower odds ratios (ORs) for these conditions. In men, the ORs were 0.21 (95% CI 0.17-0.25) for dyslipidemia, 0.37 (95% CI 0.30-0.45) for hypertension, and 0.16 (95% CI 0.10-0.23) for diabetes. Similarly, in women, the ORs were 0.22 (95% CI 0.19-0.26), 0.51 (95% CI 0.42-0.61), and 0.19 (95% CI 0.13-0.27). Quartile analysis showed that participants in the highest quartile (Q4) had significantly lower ORs compared to those in the lowest quartile (Q1). In men, Q4 ORs were 0.18 (95% CI 0.14-0.23) for dyslipidemia, 0.30 (95% CI 0.23-0.39) for hypertension, and 0.11 (95% CI 0.06-0.20) for diabetes.

Dyslipidemia and diabetes demonstrated nonlinear patterns, while a linear association was found for hypertension. Subgroup analyses across various characteristics confirmed these findings with no substantial directional changes. Maintaining an appropriate ratio of LMI to VFMI may be associated with favorable metabolic health."

    "abstract": "RecQ helicases, highly conserved proteins with pivotal roles in DNA replication, DNA repair and homologous recombination, are crucial for maintaining genomic integrity. Mutations in RECQL4 have been associated with various human diseases, including Rothmund-Thomson syndrome. RECQL4 is involved in regulating major DNA repair pathways, such as homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). RECQL4 has more prominent single-strand DNA annealing activity than helicase activity. Its ability to promote DNA damage repair and the precise role of its DNA annealing activity in DNA repair are unclear. Here we demonstrate that PARP1 interacts with RECQL4, increasing its single-stranded DNA strand annealing activity. PARP1 specifically promoted RECQL4 PARylation at both its N- and C-terminal regions, promoting RECQL4 recruitment to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Inhibition or depletion of PARP1 significantly diminished RECQL4 recruitment and occupancy at specific DSB sites on chromosomes. After DNA damage, PARG dePARylated RECQL4 and stimulated its end-joining activity. RECQL4 actively displaced replication protein A from single-stranded DNA, promoting microhomology annealing in vitro. Furthermore, depletion of PARP1 or RECQL4 substantially impacted classical-NHEJ- and alternative-NHEJ-mediated DSB repair. Consequently, the combined activities of PARP1, PARG and RECQL4 modulate DNA repair."

To target LSCs, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) provide an elegant solution, combining the specificity of antibodies with highly potent payloads. We aimed to investigate if FLT3-20D9h3-ADCs delivering either the DNA-alkylator duocarmycin (DUBA) or the microtubule-toxin monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) can eradicate quiescent LSCs. We show here that DUBA more potently kills cell-cycle arrested AML cells compared to microtubule-targeting auristatins. Due to limited stability of 20D9h3-DUBA ADC in vivo, we analyzed both ADCs in advanced in vitro stem cell assays. 20D9h3-DUBA successfully eliminated leukemic progenitors in vitro in colony-forming unit and long-term culture initiating cell assays, both in patient cells and in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells. Further, it completely prevented engraftment of AML PDX leukemia-initiating cells in NSG mice. 20D9h3-MMAF had a similar effect in engraftment assays, but a less prominent effect in colony assays. Both ADCs did not affect healthy stem and progenitor cells at comparable doses providing the rationale for FLT3 as therapeutic LSC target. Collectively, we show that FLT3-directed ADCs with DUBA or MMAF have potent activity against AML LSCs and represent promising candidates for further clinical development."

Identification of additional E3 ligases capable of supporting TPD would unlock the full potential of this mechanism for both research and pharmaceutical applications. This perspective discusses recent strategies to expand the scope of TPD and the surprising convergence of these diverse screening efforts on a handful of E3 ligases, specifically DCAF16, DCAF11 and FBXO22. We speculate that a combination of properties, including superficial ligandability, potential for promiscuous substrate interactions and high occupancy in Cullin-RING complexes, may position these E3 ligases as 'low-hanging fruit' in TPD screens. We also discuss complementary approaches that might further expand the E3 ligase landscape supporting TPD."

Navax treatment reduced IL-6 by 1.35- to 1.74-fold and TNF-α by 1.17- to 1.45-fold, more effectively than the Control group (p < 0.05). These results suggest that nasal-spray Bacillus spore probiotics, with their ability to reduce bacterial load and modulate immune responses, provide a cost-effective and safe solution for alleviating symptoms of both ARS and AOM in children.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier NCT05804123 on April 7, 2023."

    "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus pose a significant threat in healthcare, demanding urgent therapeutic solutions. Combining bacteriophages with conventional antibiotics, an innovative approach termed phage-antibiotic synergy, presents a promising treatment avenue. However, to enable new treatment strategies, there is a pressing need for methods to assess their efficacy reliably and rapidly. Here, we introduce a novel approach for real-time monitoring of pathogen lysis dynamics employing the piezoelectric quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) with dissipation (QCM-D) technique. The sensor, a QCM chip modified with the bacterium S. aureus RN4220 ΔtarM, was utilized to monitor the activity of the enzyme lysostaphin and the phage P68 as model lytic agents. Unlike conventional QCM solely measuring resonance frequency changes, our study demonstrates that dissipation monitoring enables differentiation of bacterial growth and lysis caused by cell-attached lytic agents. Compared to reference turbidimetry measurements, our results reveal distinct alterations in the growth curve of the bacteria adhered to the sensor, characterized by a delayed lag phase. Furthermore, the dissipation signal analysis facilitated the precise real-time monitoring of phage-mediated lysis. Finally, the QCM-D biosensor was employed to evaluate the synergistic effect of subinhibitory concentrations of the antibiotic amoxicillin with the bacteriophage P68, enabling monitoring of the lysis of P68-resistant wild-type strain S. aureus RN4220. Our findings suggest that this synergy also impedes the formation of bacterial aggregates, the precursors of biofilm formation. Overall, this method brings new insights into phage-antibiotic synergy, underpinning it as a promising strategy against antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains with broad implications for treatment and prevention."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify clinical characteristics and develop a prognostic model for non-neutropenic patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). A retrospective analysis of 151 IPA patients was conducted, with patients categorized into survival (n = 117) and death (n = 34) groups. Clinical data, including demographics, laboratory tests, and imaging, were collected. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified glucocorticoid use (odds ratio [OR] = 30.223, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.676-341.306), intensive care unit admission (OR = 0.133, 95% CI: 0.023-0.758), and the arterial oxygen partial pressure/fractional inspired oxygen ratio (OR = 0.994, 95% CI: 0.990-0.999) as significant predictors of 28-day mortality. A prognostic model was developed based on these factors, showing high predictive accuracy (receiver operating characteristic curve area of 0.918). The model's clinical applicability was validated through calibration curves, bootstrap internal validation, decision curve analysis, and clinical impact curves. Kaplan-Meier analysis further confirmed its utility, indicating a worse prognosis for high-risk patients within 50 days and the highest survival rate at 14 days. This novel model offers valuable insights for predicting survival in non-neutropenic IPA patients."

It has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 variants escape neutralizing immunity elicited by previous infection and/or vaccination, leading to new infection waves and cases of reinfection. The study aims to gain into cases of reinfections, particularly infections and/or vaccination-induced protection. We conducted a retrospective descriptive study using data collected during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This analysis involved Reverse Transcriptase Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). RT-qPCR was performed on 416,466 naso-oropharyngeal swabs, with 10,380 samples further analyzed using NGS technology. RT-qPCR identified 350 cases of reinfection, of which 228 were subjected to detailed analysis via NGS. Our findings revealed two interesting cases involving pediatric patients who were not vaccinated. Positive results were observed in these cases within a short interval (< 60 days) and the \"nature\" of the infection, whether attributable to Reinfection or Viral Persistence, was investigated. Specifically, we discuss a case involving an unvaccinated 18-month-old child, which may represent one of the earliest instances of BA.5/BA.5 reinfection identified worldwide."

The original version of the NAD World concept was proposed in 2009, providing an integrated view of the NAD+-centric, systemic regulatory network for mammalian aging and longevity control. The reformulated version of the concept, the NAD World 2.0, was then proposed in 2016, emphasizing the importance of the inter-tissue communications between the hypothalamus and peripheral tissues including adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. There has been significant progress in our understanding of the importance of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a key NAD+ intermediate, and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), particularly extracellular NAMPT (eNAMPT). With these exciting developments, the further reformulated version of the concept, the NAD World 3.0, is now proposed, featuring multi-layered feedback loops mediated by NMN and eNAMPT for mammalian aging and longevity control."

Additionally, we analyze 17 cancer open reading frame screens to identify genes toxic to cancer cells when overexpressed. Combining these approaches, we propose a class of 'Amplification-Related Gain Of Sensitivity' (ARGOS) genes located in commonly amplified regions, yet expressed at lower levels than expected by their copy number, and toxic when overexpressed. We validate RBM14 as an ARGOS gene in lung and breast cancer cells, and suggest a toxicity mechanism involving altered DNA damage response and STING signaling.

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) ultimately causes renal fibrosis and end-stage renal disease, thus seriously threatens human health. However, current medications for CKD and fibrosis are inefficient, which is often due to poor targeting capability to renal tubule. In this study, we discover that biomimetic high-density lipoprotein (bHDL) lipid nanoparticles possess excellent targeting ability to injured tubular epithelial cells by kidney injury molecule-1(KIM-1) mediated internalization. Thus, we co-load anti-inflammatory drug triptolide (TP) and anti-fibrotic drug nintedanib (BIBF) on bHDL nanoparticles to treat CKD. Based on the targeted delivery and mutual enhancement of the efficacy of co-delivered drugs, the bHDL-based system effectively reduces kidney injury and alleviates renal fibrosis in different CKD mouse models. The mechanistic study shows that BIBF and TP synergistically remodel the fibrotic niches by decreasing inflammatory cytokines, limiting immune cell infiltration and inhibiting the activation of myofibroblasts. The bHDL vehicle also possesses high manufacturability, good safety and adequately reduces the toxicity of TP. Thus, this system is promising for the treatment of CKD and bHDL has good potential for delivering agents to damaged renal tubular epithelial cells."

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DC) are key players in antitumor immune responses. Tumors exploit their plasticity to escape immune control; their aberrant surface carbohydrate patterns (e.g., glycans) shape immune responses through lectin binding, and manipulate the metabolism of immune cells, including DCs to alter their function and escape immune surveillance. DC metabolic reprogramming could induce immune subversion and tumor immune escape. Here we explore metabolic features of human DC subsets (cDC2s, cDC1s, pDCs) in melanoma, at single cell level, using the flow cytometry-based SCENITH (Single-Cell ENergetIc metabolism by profiling Translation inHibition) method. We demonstrate that circulating and tumor-infiltrating DC subsets from melanoma patients are characterized by altered metabolism, which is linked to their activation status and profile of immune checkpoint expression. This altered metabolism influences their function and affects patient clinical outcome. Notably, melanoma tumor cells directly remodel the metabolic profile of DC subsets, in a glycan-dependent manner. Strikingly, modulation of the mTOR/AMPK-dependent metabolic pathways and/or the MCT1 lactate transporter rescue cDC2s and cDC1s from skewing by tumor-derived glycans, Sialyl-Tn antigen and Fucose, and restore anti-tumor T-cell fitness. Our findings thus open the way for appropriate tuning of metabolic pathways to rescue DCs from tumor hijacking and restore potent antitumor responses."

    "abstract": "Axonal fusion represents an efficient way to recover function after nerve injury. However, how axonal fusion is induced and regulated remains largely unknown. We discover that ferroptosis signaling can promote axonal fusion and functional recovery in C. elegans in a dose-sensitive manner. Ferroptosis-induced lipid peroxidation enhances injury-triggered phosphatidylserine exposure (PS) to promote axonal fusion through PS receptor (PSR-1) and EFF-1 fusogen. Axon injury induces PSR-1 condensate formation and disruption of PSR-1 condensation inhibits axonal fusion. Extending these findings to mammalian nerve repair, we show that loss of Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a crucial suppressor of ferroptosis, promotes functional recovery after sciatic nerve injury. Applying ferroptosis inducers to mouse sciatic nerves retains nerve innervation and significantly enhances functional restoration after nerve transection and resuture without affecting axon regeneration. Our study reveals an evolutionarily conserved function of lipid peroxidation in promoting axonal fusion, providing insights for developing therapeutic strategies for nerve injury."

However, the in vivo significance of RPA binding to WRN has largely remained unexplored. We identify several conserved phosphorylation sites in the acidic domain of WRN targeted by Casein Kinase 2. These phosphorylation sites are crucial for WRN-RPA interaction. Using an unphosphorylable WRN mutant, which lacks the ability to bind RPA, we determine that the WRN-RPA complex plays a critical role in fork recovery after replication stress countering the persistence of G4 structures after fork stalling. However, the interaction between WRN and RPA is not necessary for the processing of replication forks when they collapse. The absence of WRN-RPA binding hampers fork recovery, causing single-strand DNA gaps, enlarged by MRE11, and triggering MUS81-dependent double-strand breaks, which require repair by RAD51 to prevent excessive DNA damage."

    "abstract": "TP53 mutations are recognized to correlate with a worse prognosis in individuals with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There exists an immediate necessity to pinpoint selective treatment for patients carrying TP53 mutations. Potential drugs were identified by comparing drug sensitivity differences, represented by the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), between TP53 mutant and wild-type NSCLC cell lines using database analysis. In addition, clinical data from NSCLC patients were collected to evaluate both their TP53 status and their response to gemcitabine, thereby facilitating further validation. Subsequently, NSCLC cell lines with different TP53 status (A549 and H1299) were subjected to gemcitabine treatment to investigate the association between TP53 mutations and gemcitabine response. According to the dataset, NSCLC cell lines carrying TP53 mutations displayed heightened sensitivity to gemcitabine. From a clinical standpoint, patients exhibiting TP53 hotspot mutations demonstrated prolonged overall survival upon gemcitabine treatment. In vitro, overexpressing various hotspot TP53 mutations significantly sensitized H1299 cells to gemcitabine. Moreover, the knockdown of TP53 in A549 cells notably augmented sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment, as evidenced by cell viability and reproductive cell death assays. Conversely, the overexpression of wild-type TP53 in H1299 cells led to an increased resistance against gemcitabine. Gemcitabine is a treatment option for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who carry TP53 hotspot mutations. This potential effectiveness might arise from its ability to disrupt DNA damage repair processes, leading to G2/M phase cell cycle arrest or an augmentation of mitotic abnormalities, eventually cause cell death. As a result, when planning treatment strategies for NSCLC patients possessing TP53 hotspot mutations, gemcitabine should be considered to incorporate into the indication."

This study uses penicillin allergy as an instrumental variable (IV) to estimate the causal effect of antibiotics on resistance. A retrospective cohort of 36,351 individuals with E. coli positive urine cultures and prior outpatient antibiotic use, with outcomes assessed up to one year post-exposure, was analyzed using data from Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), the second-largest non-profit health fund in Israel. IV methods estimated risk differences (RD) and numbers needed to harm (NNH) for penicillin versus other antibiotics. The RD for resistance was 11.4% (95% CI: 7.6%, 15.4%) for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 14.1% (95% CI: 9.0%, 19.4%) for ampicillin, and 0.8% (95% CI: 0.2%, 1.4%) for piperacillin/tazobactam, with NNHs of 8.8, 7.1, and 122.0, respectively. Risks declined over time since exposure. Gentamicin, used as a negative control, showed no effect (95% CI: -2.4%, 1.8%). When directly comparing penicillin and quinolone effects on their respective AMR, penicillin use within 180 days increased resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid by an RD of 17.8% (95% CI: 2.1%, 35.2%; NNH: 5.6), while quinolones raised ciprofloxacin resistance by 43.9% (95% CI: 29.9%, 59.4%; NNH: 2.3). These findings provide quantitative evidence of the impact of prior penicillin use on resistance, with implications for clinical practice and prescription policies."

Inhibiting CAF-FAP combined with anti-PD-1 in orthotopic HCC models led to improved tumor regression than either monotherapy. Collectively, our findings suggest stroma-targeted strategies for HCC based on defined stromal archetypes, raising the concept that CAFs change their transcriptional program and intercellular crosstalk according to the spatial context."

Both disorders share clinical features, which can lead to monogenic forms being misdiagnosed as T1D. However, correct diagnosis is crucial for therapeutic choice, prognosis and genetic counseling. The aim of this study was to search for monogenic autoimmune diabetes in Spanish pediatric patients with early-onset T1D.\nMethods: Among 500 Spanish pediatric patients with T1D, those with disease onset between 9 and 30 months of age were selected for screening for monogenic autoimmune diabetes (n=44). Genetic testing was performed by NGS with a customized panel that included the major causative genes for monogenic autoimmune syndromes, including early-onset diabetes: AIRE, CTLA4, FOXP3, IL2RA, ITCH, LRBA, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5B. RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing of the RNA isolated from whole blood were used to analyze splicing variants.\nResults: Genetic screening identified, in two patients with diabetes onset under one year of age, two likely pathogenic novel variants affecting canonical splicing sites: c.286-12_290del in STAT5B and c.-22-2delA in FOXP3. RNA analyses demonstrated that both variants modify mRNA splicing. The variant in STAT5B induced exon 4 skipping and the variant in FOXP3 caused a deletion of 16 nucleotides before the transcription start-site.\nConclusions: T1D onset in the first year of life may indicate monogenic autoimmune diabetes and molecular testing may be recommended."

    "abstract": "Background: Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) signaling blockade by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) effectively restores immune surveillance to treat melanoma. However, chronic interferon-gamma (IFNγ)-induced immune homeostatic responses in melanoma cells contribute to immune evasion and acquired resistance to ICI. Poly ADP ribosyl polymerase 14 (PARP14), an IFNγ-responsive gene product, partially mediates IFNγ-driven resistance. PARP14 inhibition prolongs PD-1 blockade responses in preclinical models, but fails to achieve full tumor clearance, suggesting the involvement of additional resistance mechanisms.\nMethods: We identified a robust PARP14 catalytic inhibitor gene signature and evaluated its association with patient survival. Using preclinical models and single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigated immune and tumor cell adaptations to PARP14 inhibition combined with PD-1 blockade.\nResults: Combining PARP14 inhibition and PD-1 blockade suppressed tumor-associated macrophages while increasing proinflammatory memory macrophages. Moreover, this combination mitigated the terminal exhaustion of cytotoxic T cells by inducing a quiescent state, thereby preserving functionality. Despite the enhanced immune responses, tumor cells developed adaptive resistance by engaging alternative immune evasion pathways.\nConclusions: Although adaptive resistance mechanisms re-emerge, PARP14 inhibition combined with PD-1 blockade offers a promising strategy to enhance treatment outcomes and overcome ICI resistance in melanoma, as immune cells are primed for further therapeutic interventions that leverage the quiescent state."

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are key components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and have been implicated in the immune response to cancer. However, the role and difference of TLSs and TILs in patients with cholangiocarcinoma remains unclear. This study elucidates their contributions to the TME.\nMethods: We examined 16 tumor samples from a single-arm, phase II trial of nivolumab plus modified gemcitabine and S-1 and various datasets. Immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing were employed to assess TLSs and TILs presence and activity. Differential gene expression and signature of immune cell composition were examined by GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler and Cancer Transcriptome Altas analysis.\nResults: TLS-positive (N=7) patients demonstrated significantly better immunotherapy outcomes compared with TLS-negative (N=9) patients, including higher objective response rates (71% vs 0%) and disease control rates (100% vs 67%). The presence of TLSs correlated with improved progression-free and overall survival (p=0.03). TLSs were associated with \"inflamed\" tumors characterized by substantial immune infiltration, particularly involving T and B cells. Gene expression analyses identified significant upregulation of B cell-related genes in TLSs. Additionally, TLSs exhibited higher properties of memory B cells and myeloid dendritic cells but lower levels of innate immune cells compared with TILs. T cells within TLSs showed elevated expression of precursor-exhausted-related genes and lower cytotoxicity signature. Furthermore, TILs in TLS-positive tumors had higher levels of exhaustion signatures compared with TILs in TLS-negative tumors. Clinical data corroborated these findings, with higher PD-L1 and LAG-3 expression in TLS-positive tumors.\nConclusion: Our findings revealed that TILs in TLS-positive tumors have more exhausted T cell signature and PD-1 and LAG-3 protein expression in CCA which support our clinical finding. TLSs can predict favorable immunotherapy responses in patients with cholangiocarcinoma, highlighting their potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target to enhance treatment efficacy."

Metagenomes were analysed to identify signatures of emulsifier sensitivity.\nResults: Exposure of human microbiotas, maintained in the MBRA, to CMC recapitulated the differential CMC sensitivity previously observed in FRESH subjects. Furthermore, select FRESH control subjects (ie, not fed CMC) had microbiotas that were highly perturbed by CMC exposure in the MBRA model. CMC-induced microbiota perturbability was associated with a baseline metagenomic signature, suggesting the possibility of using one's metagenome to predict sensitivity to dietary emulsifiers. Transplant of human microbiotas that the MBRA model deemed CMC-sensitive, but not those deemed insensitive, into IL-10-/- germfree mice resulted in overt colitis following CMC feeding.\nConclusion: These results suggest that an individual's sensitivity to emulsifier is a consequence of, and can thus be predicted by, examining their baseline microbiota, paving the way to microbiota-based personalised nutrition."

B. pseudolongum mediates the FMD antitumour effects by increasing the tissue-resident memory CD8+ T-cell (TRM) population in CRC mice. The level of L-arginine, a B. pseudolongum functional metabolite, increased in FMD-treated CRC mice; furthermore, L-arginine induced the TRM phenotype in vivo and in vitro.

Both FMD and B. pseudolongum improved anti-CTLA-4 efficacy in the orthotopic mouse CRC model. In FMD-treated patients with CRC, the CD8+ TRM cell number increased as B. pseudolongum and L-arginine accumulated. The abundance of CD8+ TRM cells and B. pseudolongum was associated with a better prognosis in patients with CRC.\nConclusion: B. pseudolongum contributes to the FMD antitumour effects in CRC by producing L-arginine. This promotes CD8+ T-cell differentiation into memory cells. B. pseudolongum administration is a potential CRC therapeutic strategy."

    "abstract": "Background: Cyst size, its growth rate, and diameter of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) are all associated with pancreatic carcinoma prevalence in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs).\nObjective: To examine the above factors in relation to future risk of incident pancreatic carcinoma in individuals with IPMNs harbouring no high-risk stigmata.\nDesign: In a prospective longitudinal cohort, we analysed 2549 patients with IPMNs. A multivariable cause-specific Cox proportional hazards regression model was built to estimate HRs for incident pancreatic carcinoma.\nResults: IPMN size at baseline and its annual growth rate over 2 years of follow-up were associated with incident pancreatic carcinoma (ptrend<0.001). The multivariable cause-specific HR per 10 mm increase in IPMN size was 1.28 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.50). The annual growth rates of 1.5-2.4 mm/year and ≥2.5 mm/year over 2 years were associated with multivariable cause-specific HRs of 1.91 (95% CI 0.78 to 4.67) and 4.52 (95% CI 2.28 to 8.98), respectively (vs <1.5 mm/year). Neither IPMN size at 5 years nor its maximum growth rate during 5 years was associated with incident pancreatic carcinoma (ptrend>0.07). MPD diameter at 5 years was associated with incident pancreatic carcinoma (multivariable cause-specific HR per 2 mm increase, 2.12; 95% CI 1.72 to 2.63). A predictive nomogram was generated for calculating the risk of incident pancreatic carcinoma.\nConclusion: IPMN size and its growth rate predict future pancreatic carcinoma risk only during first 5 years of follow-up. MPD diameter at 5 years may identify patients who still harbour a high risk for pancreatic carcinoma."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Psoriasis (PsO) is a common chronic, inflammatory, immune-mediated disease. In 2023, a 4.4% prevalence of PsO was reported in Portugal. Currently, Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitors (TNFi) are the recommended first-line (1 L) biologic agents in Portugal given their lower cost. However, TNFi may not be suitable for several patients. In these patients, interleukin inhibitors (ILi) should be considered as they provide more effective outcomes and a better safety profile.\nMethods: Qualitative interviews with PsO experts were conducted to identify PsO biologic treatment needs, resulting in an online survey to explore clinical cases focused on subpopulations of PsO. A delphi study evaluated consensus on clinical criteria to initiate non-TNFi therapy in seven predefined subpopulations of patients.\nResults: This study highlights the benefit of starting non-TNFi therapy in all PsO predefined subpopulations. Patients with infection risk, mild heart failure and associated comorbidities, autoimmune diseases and family history of demyelinating disease consensually benefit from starting non-TNFi therapy in 1 L. Several risks associated with latent tuberculosis, advanced age and oncological disease were also evaluated.\nConclusion: Given the existence of various risks associated with TNFi usage, this clinical perspective overview of Portuguese experts in PsO treatment emphasizes the need for a tailored therapeutic framework in the management of PsO."

After an initially successful treatment, the patient developed a rosacea-like dermatitis. At first, dupilumab was continued alongside doxycycline, metronidazole gel and ivermectin cream.\nResults: Following a worsening of her skin condition, dupilumab was discontinued. Lebrikizumab was introduced, leading to significant regression of the lesions.\nConclusions: This case highlights a rare paradoxical skin reaction to dupilumab, potentially linked to the blockade of IL-4Rα, which may shift the immune response towards a Th1/Th17 phenotype. The findings suggest that alternative therapies, such as IL-13 inhibitors, should be considered when cutaneous side effects arise during dupilumab treatment."

Microbial diversity was assessed using 16S rRNA V3 and V4 sequencing. A novel metaproteomics pipeline identified bacterial proteins, while untargeted metabolomics explored altered metabolic pathways. Finally, multi-omics integration was employed to connect macromolecular changes to neurodevelopmental deficits.\nResults: Children with ASD exhibited significant alterations in gut microbiota, including lower diversity and richness compared to controls. Tyzzerella was uniquely associated with the ASD group. Microbial network analysis revealed rewiring and reduced stability in ASD. Major metaproteins identified were produced by Bifidobacterium and Klebsiella (e.g., xylose isomerase and NADH peroxidase). Metabolomics profiling identified neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate, DOPAC), lipids, and amino acids capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, potentially contributing to neurodevelopmental and immune dysregulation. Host proteome analysis revealed altered proteins, including kallikrein (KLK1) and transthyretin (TTR), involved in neuroinflammation and immune regulation. Finally, multi-omics integration supported single-omics findings and reinforced the hypothesis that gut microbiota and their macromolecular products may contribute to ASD-associated symptoms.\nConclusions: The integration of multi-omics data provided critical evidence that alteration in gut microbiota and associated macromolecule production may play a role in ASD-related symptoms and co-morbidities. Key bacterial metaproteins and metabolites were identified as potential contributors to neurological and immune dysregulation in ASD, underscoring possible novel targets for therapeutic intervention."

    "abstract": "Obesity is a global health crisis linked to numerous adverse outcomes including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and cognitive decline. This study investigated the sex-specific effects of monosodium glutamate (MSG)-induced obesity on learning, memory, anxiety-like behavior, oxidative stress, and genotoxicity in rats. In 32 neonatal Wistar albino rats, subcutaneous MSG injections were administered to induce obesity. Both male and female obese rats displayed significant abdominal fat accumulation, with a more pronounced increase in females. Cognitive assessments using the Morris Water Maze test revealed substantial impairments in learning and memory in both sexes, although no significant sex-related differences were observed. Anxiety-like behavior remained unaffected by obesity in both sexes, as indicated by behavioral tests. Oxidative stress in the hippocampus, measured by total oxidant and antioxidant levels, did not show significant alterations. However, the study found genotoxic effects in female obese rats, indicated by DNA damage, whereas male rats did not exhibit such effects. The results suggest that MSG-induced obesity negatively impacts cognitive function and causes genotoxicity, particularly in females, highlighting the potential sex-specific vulnerabilities in obesity-related pathologies. This research provides valuable insights into the cognitive and genetic consequences of obesity, with implications for understanding complex biological mechanisms across sexes."

    "abstract": "Background: Industrial processing and storage of milk products can strongly increase protein glycation level. Previously, we have reported that ingestion of highly glycated milk protein attenuates the post-prandial rise in plasma lysine concentrations when compared to the ingestion of an equivalent amount of milk protein with a low glycation level. Whether the attenuated increase in plasma lysine availability is attributed to compromised protein digestion and subsequent lysine absorption remains to be established.\nObjective: The present study combined stable isotope methodology with the ingestion of, specifically produced, intrinsically labeled protein to assess protein digestion and amino acid absorption following ingestion of milk protein with a high versus low glycation level in vivo in humans.\nMethods: 15 recreationally active, healthy young males participated in this double-blinded, randomized cross-over study. Subjects ingested 40 g intrinsically L-[1-13C]-lysine-labeled milk protein with either a low (3%) or high (50%) glycation level. Continuous intravenous infusion of L-[4,4,5,5-2H4]-lysine was combined with frequent blood sample collection during a 6-h post-prandial period to evaluate dietary protein-derived lysine release into the circulation.\nResults: Post-prandial plasma lysine concentrations were lower following the ingestion of milk protein with a high versus low glycation level (time*treatment effect: P=0.002; ƞ2=0.214), resulting in a 23 mmol·L-1·360 min-1 [95%-CI:13-32] lower incremental area under the curve (0±12 vs 23±11 mmol·L-1·360 min-1, respectively, P<0.001). The post-prandial release of milk protein-derived lysine into the circulation was attenuated following ingestion of the protein with the high versus low glycation level (time*treatment effect: P<0.001; ƞ2=0.640) and was 31% [95%-CI:26-36] lower over the full 6-h post-prandial period (18±4 vs 49±10% of the ingested lysine, respectively, P<0.001).\nConclusions: A high level of milk protein glycation strongly reduces post-prandial plasma lysine availability in vivo in humans. Industrial processing and storage of (milk) protein products can strongly modulate protein bioavailability and, as such, lower the nutritional value of a protein source.

    "heading": "Reducing IgG accumulation via neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blockade relieves neuropathic pain",
    "abstract": "Preclinical and clinical studies have established that autoreactive immunoglobulin G (IgG) can drive neuropathic pain. We recently demonstrated that sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI) in male and female mice results in the production of pronociceptive IgG, which accumulates around the lumbar region, including within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord, facilitating the development of neuropathic pain. These data raise the intriguing possibility that neuropathic pain may be alleviated by reducing the accumulation of IgG. To this end, we tested whether biologic inhibition or genetic deletion of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) would attenuate mechanical hypersensitivity (allodynia) and IgG deposition induced by CCI. FcRn are prominently expressed on myeloid and endothelial cells and extend the half-life of IgG via pinocytosis and recycling into the extracellular milieu. We show here that administration of the FcRn blocker efgartigimod either 7- or 28-days post-CCI relieved allodynia among both male and female mice, compared to the Fc fragment control. Efgartigimod, administered systemically (intraperitoneal) or to the lumbar region (intrathecal), attenuated mechanical allodynia for at least one month w. CCI-induced allodynia was similarly reduced in FcRn-deficient (FcRn-) mice compared to wild-type mice. Biologic inhibition or genetic deletion of FcRn also reduced CCI-induced accumulation of IgG on macrophages and neurons in lumbar DRG, as well as microglia in the lumbar dorsal spinal cord. Expression of the Fc receptor γ subunit (FcRγ) was reduced in efgartigimod-treated or FcRn- mice post-CCI compared to controls. The FcRγ subunit is a key component of Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs), which are activated by IgG immune complexes. In macrophage cultures stimulated by IgG immune complexes, FcRn blockade also dampened FcγR-dependent production of proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, our study demonstrates that FcRn blockade or deletion alleviates mechanical allodynia and reduces IgG accumulation after CCI, attenuating pronociceptive IgG-FcγR signaling around the lumbar region. Strategies to block FcRn and reduce IgG recycling warrant further investigation as potential treatments for IgG-mediated neuropathic pain."

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant global health challenge, particularly due to the resistance of gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs) to chemotherapy. This study investigates the role of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (HNRNPA2B1), a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), in modulating mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming and contributing to chemoresistance in GCSCs. Through extensive analysis of tumor cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets, HNRNPA2B1 was identified as a key regulator in GCSCs, correlating with poor prognosis and enhanced resistance to chemoresistance. CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of HNRNPA2B1 in GCSCs led to a significant decrease in mitochondrial function, reduced migration, invasion, and sphere formation abilities, and markedly increased apoptosis. These changes were accompanied by a shift in metabolic activity, evidenced by decreased oxygen consumption and increased extracellular acidification. Our results highlight HNRNPA2B1 as a pivotal factor in sustaining the malignant phenotype of GCSCs and present it as a potential therapeutic target to improve chemotherapy efficacy in GC."

    "abstract": "Background: The World Health Organization has identified Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) as a priority disease for research and development in emergency contexts. The epidemiology of CCHF is evolving and this review highlights travel-associated cases and focuses on the need for a One Health approach in Europe.\nMethods: For this narrative review, two searches were performed in PubMed and Google Scholar for the period 1980-October 2024. The first search identified travel-associated CCHF cases globally, additional cases were identified in the ProMED mail database and through healthmap.org. The second search, with a focus on the European region, aimed to analyse reports of CCHF virus (CCHFV) detected in ticks, CCHF seroprevalence studies in animals and/or humans, and autochthonous CCHF cases.\nResults: Seventeen cases of imported CCHF, the majority acquired in Africa, were identified. Importation to European countries accounted for eight of the cases. Most patients presented with fever and hemorrhagic manifestations and the estimated case fatality rate was 35%. In the WHO European region, 13 countries have reported ticks infected with different genotypes of CCHFV; 17 countries were found to have animals/humans with positive CCHF serology. Finally, 16 countries in the WHO European region have notified human cases of CCHF. The Russian Federation, Turkey, and several former USSR countries are considered highly endemic, followed by the Balkanic region, with sporadic cases emerging in Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, and recently Portugal.\nConclusions: Travel-associated CCHF is infrequent. However, given the recently reported increased geographical distribution in ticks and animals in the European region, additional human cases may be anticipated in the near future. Europe receives over half of all international tourist arrivals annually, so healthcare professionals should be aware of risk factors and current protocols for the management of suspected and confirmed cases."

    "abstract": "In this article, our goal is to offer an introduction and overview of the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet function defects (iPFDs) for clinicians and laboratory personnel who are beginning to engage in the field. We describe the most commonly used laboratory methods and propose a diagnostic four-step approach, wherein each stage requires a higher level of expertise and more specialized methods. It should be noted that our proposed approach differs from the ISTH Guidance on this topic in some points. The first step in the diagnostic approach of iPFD should be a thorough medical history and clinical examination. We strongly advocate for the use of a validated bleeding score like the ISTH-BAT (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Bleeding Assessment Tool). External factors like diet and medication have to be considered. The second step should rule out plasmatic bleeding disorders and von Willebrand disease. Once this has been accomplished, the third step consists of a thorough platelet investigation of platelet phenotype and function. Established methods consist of blood smear analysis by light microscopy, light transmission aggregometry, and flow cytometry. Additional techniques such as lumiaggregometry, immune fluorescence microscopy, and platelet-dependent thrombin generation help confirm and specify the diagnosis of iPFD. In the fourth and last step, genetic testing can confirm a diagnosis, reveal novel mutations, and allow to compare unclear genetics with lab results. If diagnosis cannot be established through this process, experimental methods such as electron microscopy can give insight into the underlying disease."

    "heading": "The Diagnostic Assessment of Platelet Function Defects",
    "abstract": "Congenital platelet disorders are rare and targeted treatment is usually not possible. Inherited platelet function disorders (iPFDs) can affect surface receptors and multiple platelet responses such as defects of platelet granules, signal transduction, and procoagulant activity. If iPFDs are also associated with a reduced platelet count (thrombocytopenia), it is not uncommon to be misdiagnosed as immune thrombocytopenia. Because the bleeding tendency of the different platelet disorders is variable, a correct diagnosis of the platelet defect based on phenotyping, function analysis, and genotyping is essential, especially in the perioperative setting. In the case of a platelet receptor deficiency, such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome or Glanzmann thrombasthenia, not only the bleeding tendency but also the risk of isoimmunization after platelet transfusions or pregnancy has to be considered. Platelet granule disorders are commonly associated with either intrinsically quantitative or qualitative granule defects due to impaired granulopoiesis, or granule release defects, which can also affect additional signaling pathways. Functional platelet defects require expertise in the clinical bleeding tendency in terms of the disorder when using antiplatelet agents or other medications that affect platelet function. Platelet defects associated with hematological-oncological diseases require comprehensive information about the patient including the clinical implication of the genetic testing. This review focuses on genetics, clinical presentation, and laboratory platelet function analysis of iPFDs with or without reduced platelet number. As platelet defects affecting the cytoskeleton usually show thrombocytopenia, but less impaired or normal platelet functional responses, they are not specifically addressed."

Advancements driven by the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis have largely focused on viruses, but effective prophylactic solutions for bacterial pathogens are also needed, especially in light of the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenomenon. Here, we discuss various innovative key technologies that can help address this critical need, such as (a) the development of Lung-on-Chip ex vivo models to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis process and the host-microbe interactions; (b) a more thorough investigation of the mechanisms behind mucosal immunity as the first line of defense against pathogens; (c) the identification of correlates of protection (CoPs) which, in conjunction with the Reverse Vaccinology 2.0 approach, can push a more rational and targeted design of vaccines. By focusing on these critical areas, we expect substantial progress in the development of new vaccines against respiratory bacterial pathogens, thereby enhancing global health protection in the framework of the increasingly concerning AMR emergence."

    "abstract": "The extent to which newer, incretin-based drugs for obesity improve disease outcomes via weight loss versus the direct effects of these drugs is the subject of intense interest. Although reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events appear to be predominantly driven by the direct tissue effects of such drugs, the associated weight loss effects must be relevant to the benefits observed in other major outcomes, albeit to differing extents. In this Personal View, we draw on evidence to support that weight loss is at least partly responsible (albeit to differing extents) for the reported benefits of incretin-based drugs for obesity in people living with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes. Concurrently, we propose that drug-induced weight loss is largely responsible for the reported improvements in osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnoea, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis outcomes. However, more evidence is needed to solidify these observations, including, when possible, trials comparing the effects of incretin-based drugs for obesity with calorie-reduced diets on both outcomes and mechanistic pathways. Such evidence has implications for public health and the design of future trials of novel drugs for obesity."

    "abstract": "Background: Lerodalcibep, a small binding anti-PCSK9 protein (adnectin), showed effective LDL cholesterol reduction in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of lerodalcibep and evolocumab in a globally diverse homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia population.\nMethods: This phase 3, randomised, open-label, crossover, non-inferiority study consisted of two 24-week treatment periods separated by an 8-week washout. The study was conducted in 12 lipid clinics in six countries (India, Israel, Norway, South Africa, Türkiye, and the USA). Patients aged 10 years or older with genetically confirmed homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia were randomly assigned by computer-generated randomisation scheme performed centrally via interactive response technology to either monthly lerodalcibep 300 mg (1·2 mL subcutaneous injection) or monthly evolocumab 420 mg (subcutaneous 9 min infusion of 3·5 mL) for 24 weeks (period A) followed by an 8-week washout and then crossed over to the alternate therapy for the next 24 weeks (period B). The trial was open label, but all efficacy parameters were masked to patients, study staff, and the sponsor from randomisation. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change from baseline (day 1 of period A) in LDL cholesterol concentration to week 24 for period A and B. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomly assigned patients, was used for the primary analysis. The safety population included all patients who received any study medication. The margin used to establish non-inferiority was 6%. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04034485) and EudraCT (2019-003611-62), and has now finished.\nFindings: Patients were enrolled from Nov 11, 2019, to July 2, 2021, and the final study visit took place on Aug 8, 2022. Of 82 patients screened, 66 entered period A (ITT population). The mean age was 28·7 years (SD 15·2); 20 (30%) of 66 were paediatric patients; 36 (55%) of 66 were female and 30 (45%) of 66 were male; and the mean baseline LDL cholesterol was 10·59 mmol/L (SD 4·37). Mean LDL cholesterol reduction by ITT analysis at week 24 was -4·9% (SE 3·5) on lerodalcibep compared with -10·3% (3·5) on evolocumab; the mean difference between treatments was 5·4% (95% CI -0·2 to 11·1), which did not show non-inferiority at the prespecified 6% margin. LDL cholesterol response varied considerably across the patient population but was generally similar in the same patients with both lerodalcibep and evolocumab. When averaged across all monthly visits, LDL cholesterol response was -9·1% (SE 3·2) on lerodalcibep and -10·8% (3·2) on evolocumab. Importantly, genotyping and free PCSK9 suppression were not predictive of response. Both drugs were well tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events. Injection site reactions were reported in one (2%) of 65 patients on lerodalcibep and 15 (24%) of 62 patients on evolocumab.\nInterpretation: The LDL cholesterol response was highly variable, but generally similar in patients treated with both lerodalcibep and evolocumab. Importantly, the study showed the inability to predict response based on genotyping, reinforcing the rationale for PCSK9 inhibition in all patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and continuing its use in responders.\nFunding: LIB Therapeutics."

This study aims to investigate the relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and the incidence of stroke in a CKD population.\nMethods: This cross-sectional study analyzed the relationship between eGFR, UACR, and prevalence of self-reported stroke in 6,037 participants using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007 to 2018. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association of eGFR, UACR with the incidence of stroke, and smoothing curve fitting was applied to explore the linear relationship between eGFR and stroke. To further explore the effect of eGFR on stroke risk, we performed subgroup analyses of demographic factors.\nResults: After adjusting for confounding factors, eGFR was found to be significantly negatively associated with stroke risk. Compared with participants with an eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, the risk of stroke was increased in those with an eGFR of 60-90 (OR = 1.78; 95% CI = 1.18-2.69), 30-60 (OR = 2.26; 95% CI = 1.49-3.44), and <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (OR = 3.14; 95% CI = 1.74-5.65). In the unadjusted model, patients with UACR of 30-300 mg/g had a slightly lower risk of stroke than those with UACR < 30 mg/g (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.57-0.86); however, this association was not seen after adjusting for potential confounders.\nConclusions: This study identified a negative linear correlation between eGFR and stroke in CKD patients."

    "abstract": "Reconstructing past herd mobility, reproduction, and diet is crucial for understanding animal management practices among the first sedentary farming communities. It can also shed light on how domestic animals were integrated into the existing exchange networks of goods, products, and raw materials, and how they contributed to broader economic and social changes during the Neolithic. Despite the longstanding importance of cattle (Bos taurus) to herders, the role of cattle in the daily, seasonal, and annual cycle of activities of early farming communities remains relatively poorly understood. This study focuses on the Middle Neolithic site of Cova de les Pixarelles (3942-3632 cal. BCE) one of the few sites in the Iberian Peninsula from this period with a substantial collection of faunal remains. The site is particularly notable for its high proportion of cattle remains. Previous research on the cattle bone assemblage from Cova de les Pixarelles has included comprehensive archaeozoological, palaeopathological, and biomechanical analyses-an innovative, integrative approach in Mediterranean archaeology that offers an exceptional level of biographical detail. This study uses bulk bone collagen carbon (δ13Ccoll) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotopes, and sequential analysis of enamel bioapatite oxygen (δ18O) and carbon (δ13Ccarb) isotopes to further enhance our understanding of animal management practices during the Middle Neolithic, providing new insights on the diet, mobility and reproduction patterns of cattle. Results indicate that the Neolithic communities that used Cova de les Pixarelles managed these animals to obtain optimal pastures, moving them seasonally from lowland areas to higher mountain plateaus and carefully managing their reproduction cycles. We suggest a nuanced herding approach, combining open-range grazing with an ecological division of herds based on age, sex, and reproductive function, and seasonal vertical mobility, contributing to a complex but efficient herding system during the Middle Neolithic."

    "abstract": "Background: The common drugs used for the treatment of Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (NDMM) include bortezomib and lenalidomide, but the adverse effects of lenalidomide cannot be ignored, especially when it is used in the initial therapy.\nMethods: This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a modified DVD regimen (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, bortezomib, and dexamethasone) followed by lenalidomide in the treatment of NDMM. A total of 40 NDMM patients were treated with a reduced dose of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (20 mg/m2) on day 1, subcutaneous bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, and dexamethasone (20 mg) on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, and 12 (20 days for each course). When patients failed to achieve partial or better response after 2 courses of treatment, a regimen containing lenalidomide was administered. After the induction therapy, 15 eligible patients received Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSC) mobilization and transplantation followed by maintenance therapy with lenalidomide.\nResults: The response rate (≥ very good partial response) was 55% and 80% after 2 and 4 courses, respectively. The 18-month Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) were 78.6% and 83.4%, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity occurred in less than 10% of patients. In addition, all 15 transplant-eligible patients successfully mobilized PBSC (median CD34+cells = 4.59 × 106/kg) and underwent autologous PSBC transplantation.\nConclusions: This study suggests that the modified DVD regimen followed by lenalidomide is an effective and well-tolerated regimen, and has little influence on the PBSC collection and transplantation for patients with NDMM."

    "abstract": "Although considered an \"eco-friendly\" biodegradable plastic, polylactic acid (PLA) microplastic (PLA-MP) poses a growing concern for human health, yet its effects on male reproductive function remain underexplored. This study investigated the reproductive toxicity of PLA in male mice and its potential mechanisms. To this end, our in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that after degradation in the digestive system, a significant number of PLA-MP-derived nanoparticles could penetrate the blood-testis barrier (BTB) and localize within the spermatogenic microenvironment. Mice exposed to PLA-MPs for a long time exhibited significant reproductive toxicity, evidenced by decreased sperm concentration and motility, increased sperm deformity rates, and disrupted sex hormone levels. Further analysis revealed that PLA impaired BTB, induced mitochondrial dysfunction in the testes, and triggered oxidative stress through excessive ROS production from mitochondria, leading to further testicular damage. Notably, PLA nanoplastics internalized in the mitochondrial sheath and disrupted the mitochondrial structure of sperm, causing dose-dependent impairments in mitochondrial function. Transcriptome analyses further indicated that PLA-MPs disrupted spermatogenesis by inhibiting the expression of key mRNA involved in this process. Collectively, our findings highlight the reproductive toxic effect of biodegradable PLA by damaging BTB and impairing mitochondrial function, which provides insights into the toxicological implications of biodegradable microplastics for mammalian fertility."

These complementary principles are described in a comprehensive way, but they do not provide detailed instructions on how to use specific AI tools. Although these principles are expected to apply across different contexts and stages of the guideline enterprise, details on their implementation have some degree of flexibility. Guideline development groups choosing to use AI will be able to adequately implement the principles if they ensure aspects such as structured reporting on the use of AI tools, involvement of experts in AI, and allocation of funding for the adequate use of AI tools. The GIN principles may support guideline developers in the responsible and transparent use of AI to ensure trustworthy guidelines."

    "heading": "Effectiveness of Video Teletherapy in Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in Children and Adolescents With Exposure and Response Prevention: Retrospective Longitudinal Observational Study",
    "abstract": "Background: An effective primary treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adolescents as well as adults is exposure and response prevention (ERP), a form of intervention in the context of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Despite strong evidence supporting the efficacy and effectiveness of ERP from studies in research and real-world settings, its clinical use remains limited. This underuse is often attributed to access barriers such as the scarcity of properly trained therapists, geographical constraints, and costs. Some of these barriers may be addressed with virtual behavioral health, providing ERP for OCD through video teletherapy and supplemented by app-based therapeutic tools and messaging support between sessions. Studies of teletherapy ERP in adults with OCD have shown benefits in research and real-world settings in both small and large samples. However, studies of teletherapy ERP in children and adolescents thus far have been in small samples and limited to research rather than real-world settings.\nObjective: This study reports on the real-world effectiveness of teletherapy ERP for OCD in the largest sample (N=2173) of child and adolescent patients to date.\nMethods: Children and adolescents with OCD were treated with live, face-to-face video teletherapy sessions, with parent or caregiver involvement, using ERP. Assessments were conducted at baseline, after 7-11 weeks, and after 13-17 weeks. Additionally, longitudinal assessments of OCD symptoms were performed at weeks 18-30, 31-42, and 43-54. We analyzed longitudinal outcomes of OCD symptoms, depression, anxiety, and stress using linear mixed models.\nResults: Treatment resulted in a median 38.46% (IQR 12.50%-64.00%) decrease in OCD symptoms at 13-17 weeks, and 53.4% of youth met full response criteria at this point. Improvements were observed in all categories of starting symptom severity: mild (median 40.3%, IQR 8.5%-79.8%), moderate (median 38.4%, IQR 13.3%-63.6%), and severe (median 34.1%, IQR 6.6%-58.5%). In addition, there were significant reductions in the severity of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. The median amount of therapist involvement was 13 (IQR 10.0-16.0) appointments and 11.5 (IQR 9.0-15.0) hours. Further, symptom improvements were maintained or improved upon in the longitudinal assessment periods of weeks 18-30, 31-42, and 43-54.\nConclusions: These results show that remote ERP treatment, assisted by technology, can effectively improve both core OCD and related depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in children and adolescents with OCD in a real-world setting. Notable outcomes were achieved in a relatively small amount of therapist time, demonstrating its efficiency. Demonstrating the usefulness of a delivery format that overcomes several traditional barriers to treatment, these findings have implications for widespread dissemination of accessible, evidence-based care for children and adolescents with OCD."

    "abstract": "Background and objectives: Although previous trials have established the efficacy and safety of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in large ischemic core strokes, most of them excluded patients with extracranial internal carotid artery (e-ICA) occlusion. We aimed to compare outcomes in patients with e-ICA occlusion and large ischemic core infarcts treated with EVT vs medical management (MM).\nMethods: This was a secondary analysis of the SELECT2 trial, a randomized controlled trial conducted at 31 international sites. Adult patients with proximal intracranial anterior circulation large ischemic strokes, defined as Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) 3-5 on noncontrast CT or ischemic core ≥50 mL on CT-perfusion/magnetic resonance-diffusion imaging, and concomitant e-ICA occlusion were selected. The primary outcomes were the distribution of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90-day follow-up and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH).\nResults: Among 352 enrolled patients, 62 (17.6%) with e-ICA occlusions were included. Of those 62 patients, 37 received EVT (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age, 65 [58-71] years; 15 women [38.5%]) and 25 received MM (median [IQR] age, 66 [61-71] years; 7 women [28%]). ASPECTS (EVT: 5 [3-5] vs MM: 5 [4-5]) and ischemic core volume (EVT: 100 [69-134] mL vs MM: 103 [78-135] mL) were similar between groups. The successful reperfusion rate with EVT was 64.9%. Patients receiving EVT demonstrated significantly better functional outcomes (adjusted generalized odds ratio 2.51; 95% CI 1.43-4.39; p = 0.001) and a higher proportion of patients achieving 90-day independent ambulation (EVT: 37.8% vs MM: 8%; adjusted relative ratio [aRR] 4.58; 95% CI 1.18-17.79; p = 0.037) and functional independence (EVT: 21.6% vs MM: 8%; aRR 2.16; 95% CI 0.53-8.83; p = 0.285). Furthermore, no heterogeneity of EVT benefit was observed by the presence or absence of e-ICA occlusion (p-interaction = 0.248). There were no sICH or parenchymal hemorrhage type 2 events in either group, and mortality was similar in the 2 groups (aRR 0.75; 95% CI 0.39-1.45; p = 0.388).\nDiscussion: Among patients with e-ICA occlusions and large ischemic core stroke, EVT was associated with better functional outcomes without significant safety concerns when compared with MM. Our findings suggest that EVT in these patients is beneficial, while the optimal treatment of the extracranial carotid occlusion remains unclear.\nTrial registration information: Name of the trial: SELECT2 trial. Registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03876457. Date of registration submission: August 3, 2019. Date of first patient enrollment: November 10, 2019.\nClassification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with large core acute ischemic stroke and concomitant e-ICA occlusion, EVT is associated with better functional outcome at 90 days compared with MM alone."

    "abstract": "In thrombosis and hemostasis, the formation of a platelet-fibrin thrombus or clot is a highly controlled process that varies, depending on the pathological context. Major signaling pathways in platelets are well established. However, studies with genetically modified mice have identified the contribution of hundreds of additional platelet-expressed proteins in arterial thrombus formation and bleeding. Using phenotype information of 540 mouse genes, involved in arterial thrombosis and hemostasis, we review current insights into established and novel platelet signaling mechanisms. We discuss pathways involved in platelet adhesion, shape change, integrin activation, intracellular vesicle trafficking and protein processing, granule secretion, aggregate formation and procoagulant activity. Specific attention is paid to the signaling routes used by ITAM-linked, ITIM-linked and G protein-coupled receptors, as well as downstream events feeding into GTPase regulation and protein kinase activation. We further summarize known alterations in platelet responses under conditions of venous, inflammatory and infection-dependent thrombosis, taking into account interactions of platelets with the endothelium, leukocytes and red blood cells. Understanding the genes and proteins involved in platelet signaling in the context of hemostasis, thrombosis and inflammation may lead to improved therapies to prevent and treat thrombotic disorders."

We evaluated patient outcomes after elective discontinuation of larotrectinib in the absence of disease progression in a protocol-defined wait-and-see subset analysis of eligible patients where treatment resumption with larotrectinib was allowed if disease progressed. We also assessed the safety and efficacy of larotrectinib in all pediatric patients with sarcoma. This cohort included 91 patients (younger than 18 years) from two clinical trials: infantile fibrosarcoma (49), other soft tissue sarcomas or related mesenchymal tumors (41), and bone sarcoma (1). Treatment-related adverse events were of maximum grade 1 or 2 in 25% and 25% of patients, respectively. The overall response rate was 87% (95% CI, 78 to 93). In the wait-and-see analysis, 47 patients discontinued larotrectinib. Median time from discontinuation to disease progression was not reached. Sixteen patients had tumor progression during the wait-and-see period. All 16 patients resumed larotrectinib, and 15 (94%) achieved disease control, with 11 objective responses. Larotrectinib continues to demonstrate durable responses with favorable safety in children with TRK fusion sarcomas. Treatment discontinuation is feasible in select patients with objective response and clinical benefit noted in those who have disease progression after elective treatment discontinuation."

Here, an integrative, multi-omic approach was applied to multiple large independent datasets in order to characterize DLBCL immune environments, and to define their association with tumor cell-intrinsic genomic alterations and outcomes to CD19-directed CAR T-cell and CD20 x CD3 BsAb therapies. This approach effectively segregated DLBCLs into four immune quadrants (IQ) defined by cell-of-origin and immune-related gene set expression scores. These quadrants consisted of activated B cell-like (ABC) hot, ABC cold, germinal center B cell-like (GCB) hot, GCB cold DLBCLs. Recurrent genomic alterations were enriched in each IQ, suggesting that lymphoma cell-intrinsic alterations contribute significantly to orchestrating unique DLBCL immune environments. For instance, SOCS1 loss-of-function mutations were significantly enriched among GCB hot DLBCLs, identifying a putative subset of inflamed DLBCLs that may be inherently susceptible to immunotherapy. In relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients, DLBCL-IQ assignment correlated significantly with clinical benefit with a CD20 x CD3 BsAb (n = 74), but not with CD19-directed CAR T cells (Stanford, n = 51; MSKCC, n = 69). Thus, DLBCL-IQ provides a new framework to conceptualize the DLBCL immune landscape and suggests the endogenous immune environment has a more significant impact on outcomes to BsAb compared to CAR T cell treatment."

    "abstract": "Antibodies to β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) cause thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome, however the role of β2GPI in coagulation in vivo is not understood. To address this issue, we developed β2GPI-deficient mice (Apoh-/-) by deleting exon 2 and 3 of Apoh using CRISPR/Cas9 and compared the development of thrombosis in wild-type (WT) and Apoh-/- mice using rose bengal and FeCl3-induced carotid thrombosis, laser-induced cremaster arteriolar injury, and inferior vena cava (IVC) stasis models. We also compared tail bleeding times and activation of platelets from WT and Apoh-/- mice in the absence and presence of β2GPI. Apoh-/- mice demonstrated prolonged time to occlusion of the carotid after exposure to rose bengal or FeCl3, and reduced platelet and fibrin accumulation in cremasteric arterioles after laser injury. Significantly smaller thrombi formed in the IVC of Apoh-/- mice 48 hours after IVC occlusion. The activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time, as well as aPTT reagent and tissue factor-induced thrombin generation times of Apoh-/- and WT plasma revealed no differences. However, we observed significant prolongation of tail bleeding in Apoh-/- mice, and reduced P-selectin expression and fibrinogen binding to activated α2bβ3 on platelets from these mice after stimulation with thrombin; these changes were reversed by β2GPI. A PAR3 antibody blocked thrombin-induced activation of WT platelets and the ability of β2GPI to restore activation of Apoh-/- platelets by thrombin. These studies demonstrate that β2GPI may promote platelet activation by enhancing the ability of PAR3 to present thrombin to PAR4."

    "abstract": "Babesiosis in sickle cell disease (SCD) is marked by severe anemia but the underlying red blood cell (RBC) rheological parameters remain largely undefined. Here, we describe altered RBC deformability from both primary (host RBC sickle hemoglobin mediated) and secondary changes (Babesia parasite infection mediated) to the RBC membrane using wild type AA, sickle trait AS and sickle SS RBCs. Our ektacytometry (LORRCA) analysis demonstrates that the changes in the host RBC bio-mechanical properties, pre- and post- Babesia infection, reside on a spectrum of severity, with wild type infected AA cells, despite showing a significant reduction of deformability under both shear and osmolarity gradients, exhibiting only a mild phenotype; compared to infected AS RBCs which show median changes in deformability and infected SS RBCs which exhibit the most dramatic impact of infection on cellular rheology, including an increase in Point of Sickling values. Further, using Image stream cytometric technology to quantify changes in cellular shape and area along with a tunable resistive pulse sensor to measure release of extra-cellular vesicles (EV) from these host RBCs, before and after infection, we offer a potential mechanistic basis for this extreme SS RBC rheologic profile, which include enhanced sickling rates and osmotic fragility, loss of RBC surface area and hypervesiculation in infected SS host RBCs. These results underly the importance of understanding the impact of intra-erythrocytic parasitic infections of SCD RBCs, especially on their cellular membranes and studying the mechanisms that lead to hyper hemolysis and extreme anemia in the SCD patient population."

The purpose of this phase I study was to define the safety and efficacy of botensilimab (BOT), an Fc-enhanced anti-cytotoxic lymphocyte-association protein-4 antibody, plus balstilimab (BAL), an anti-PD-1 antibody, in advanced sarcomas.\nMethods: BOT was administered intravenously (IV) at 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg once every 6 weeks in combination with BAL IV at 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for up to 2 years. The primary end point was to determine dose-limiting toxicities during the dose-escalation period. Secondary end points include objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), disease control rate, and progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST 1.1. Exploratory end points include assessing patient biomarkers including tumor mutational burden, cytokines, and PD-L1 expression.\nResults: Overall, 64 patients with sarcoma were treated; all were evaluable for safety and 52 for efficacy. The most common treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) was diarrhea/colitis occurring in 35.9% of patients, with grade 3 in 6.3% of patients. No grade 4 or 5 TRAEs were reported. For all evaluable patients, ORR was 19.2% (95% CI, 9.6 to 32.5), and 27.8% (95% CI, 9.7 to 53.5) for evaluable patients with angiosarcoma (n = 18); 33.3% in visceral and 22.2% in cutaneous subtypes. Median PFS for evaluable patients was 4.4 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 6.1), with a 6-month PFS rate of 36% (95% CI, 22 to 50) and a median DOR of 21.7 months (95% CI, 1.9 to not reached).\nConclusion: The combination of BOT/BAL demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in a large cohort of heavily pretreated sarcoma patients.

    "abstract": "Follicular lymphoma is the most common subtype of indolent lymphoma. Despite multiple trials over the past decade showing improved progression-free survival with new first-line therapeutic strategies -such as anti-CD20 maintenance therapy and new glycoengineered anti-CD20 antibodies- no standardized approach has been widely adopted in routine clinical practice. Several factors may explain this, including the increased incidence of infectious adverse events associated with these therapies, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the lack of overall survival benefit despite long-term follow-up. A general consensus has emerged acknowledging the high prognostic variability of follicular lymphoma, which complicates the adoption of a one-size-fits-all first-line treatment strategy. A plethora of prognostic scores (FLIPI, FLIPI2, PRIMA-PI, m7-FLIPI, FLEX, 23-gene score, etc) has been proposed but none can reliably identify the ~20% of patients that will die within 10 years of first-line immunochemotherpay and for whom a critical medical need remains despite recent therapeutic improvements. Consequently, current prognostic models mainly serve as tools to cross-compare and stratify clinical trials. In this review, we highlight current and future strategies aimed at reshaping frontline treatment paradigms to improve outcomes, including tailored approaches based on risk- or response-adapted designs, development of new predictive -rather than prognostic- tools, approaches to reduce adverse events to enhance health-related quality of life, and the potential use of T-cell-engaging therapies to improve survival in the highest risk patients."

To discover new treatment targets for T-PLL, we performed high-throughput drug sensitivity screening on 30 primary patient samples ex-vivo. After screening over 2'800 unique compounds, we found T-PLL to be more resistant to most drug classes, including chemotherapeutics, compared to other blood cancers. Furthermore, we discovered previously not reported vulnerabilities of T-PLL. T-PLL cells exhibited a particular sensitivity to drugs targeting autophagy (thapsigargin, bafilomycin A1), nuclear export (selinexor), and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) (birinapant), sensitivities that were also shared by other T-cell malignancies. Through bulk and single-cell RNA-Sequencing we found these compounds to activate the toll-like-receptor (TLR) (bafilomycin A1), p53 (selinexor), and TNF-ɑ/NFκB signaling pathways (birinapant) in T-PLL cells. Focussing on birinapant for its potential in drug repurposing, we uncovered that IAP inhibitor-induced cell death was primarily necroptotic and dependent on TNF-ɑ. Through spectral flow cytometry we confirmed the absence of cleaved caspase-3 in IAP inhibitor treated T-PLL cells and show that IAP inhibition reduces the proliferation of T-PLL cells stimulated ex-vivo, while showing only a limited effect on non-malignant T-cells. In summary, our study maps the drug sensitivity of T-PLL across a broad range of targets and identifies new therapeutic approaches for T-PLL by targeting IAPs, XPO1 and autophagy, highlighting potential candidates for drug repurposing and novel treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "The L-type Ca2+ channel (CaV1.2) is essential for cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. To contribute to the inward Ca2+ flux that drives Ca2+-induced-Ca2+-release, CaV1.2 channels must be expressed on the sarcolemma; thus the regulatory mechanisms that tune CaV1.2 expression to meet contractile demand are an emerging area of research. A ubiquitously expressed protein called 14-3-3 has been proposed to affect Ca2+ channel trafficking in nonmyocytes; however, whether 14-3-3 has similar effects on CaV1.2 in cardiomyocytes is unknown. 14-3-3 preferentially binds phospho-serine/threonine residues to affect many cellular processes and is known to regulate cardiac ion channels including NaV1.5 and the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel. Altered 14-3-3 expression and function have been implicated in cardiac pathologies including hypertrophy. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that 14-3-3 interacts with CaV1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and regulates cardiac CaV1.2 trafficking and recycling. Confocal imaging, proximity ligation assays, superresolution imaging, and coimmunoprecipitation revealed a population of 14-3-3 colocalized and closely associated with CaV1.2. The degree of 14-3-3/CaV1.2 colocalization increased upon stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol. Notably, only the 14-3-3-associated CaV1.2 population displayed increased cluster size with isoproterenol, revealing a role for 14-3-3 as a nucleation factor that directs CaV1.2 superclustering. Isoproterenol-stimulated augmentation of sarcolemmal CaV1.2 expression, Ca2+ currents, and Ca2+ transients in ventricular myocytes were strengthened by 14-3-3 overexpression and attenuated by 14-3-3 inhibition. These data support a model where 14-3-3 interacts with CaV1.2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner to promote enhanced trafficking/recycling, clustering, and activity during β-adrenergic stimulation."

    "abstract": "The cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria is composed of a phospholipid bilayer made up of a diverse set of lipids. Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is one of the principal constituents and its production is essential for growth in many bacteria. All the enzymes required for PG biogenesis in Escherichia coli have been identified and characterized decades ago. However, it has remained poorly understood how gram-positive bacteria perform the terminal step in the pathway that produces this essential lipid. In E. coli, this reaction is mediated by three functionally redundant phosphatases that convert phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP) into PG. Here, we show that homologs of these enzymes in Bacillus subtilis are not required for PG synthesis. Instead, we identified a previously uncharacterized B. subtilis protein, YqeG (renamed PgpP), as an essential enzyme required for the conversion of PGP into PG. Expression of B. subtilis or Staphylococcus aureus PgpP in E. coli lacking all three Pgp enzymes supported the growth of the strain. Furthermore, depletion of PgpP in B. subtilis led to growth arrest, reduced membrane lipid staining, and accumulation of PGP. PgpP is broadly conserved among Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria. Homologs are also present in yeast mitochondria and plant chloroplasts, suggesting that this widely distributed enzyme has an ancient origin. Finally, evidence suggests that PgpP homologs are essential in many gram-positive pathogens and thus the enzyme represents an attractive target for antibiotic development."

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that chronic stress can enhance the development of multiple human diseases, including cancer. However, the role of chronic stress in esophageal carcinogenesis and its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study uncovered that dysregulated cholesterol metabolism significantly promotes esophageal carcinogenesis under chronic stress conditions. Our findings indicate that the persistent elevation of glucocorticoids induced by chronic stress stimulates cholesterol uptake, contributing to esophageal carcinogenesis. The activated glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) enrichment at the promoter region of High Mobility Group Box 2 (HMGB2) facilitates its transcription. As a transcription coactivator, HMGB2 enhances Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Transcription Factor 1 (SREBF1) transcription and regulates cholesterol metabolism through LDL particle uptake into cells via Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR). These results emphasize the significant impact of chronic stress on esophageal carcinogenesis and establish cholesterol metabolism disorder as a crucial link between chronic stress and the development of ESCC. The implications suggest that effectively managing chronic stress may serve as a viable strategy for preventing and treating ESCC."

Previous studies have linked PP2A phosphatase(s) to activation of 4E-BP1. Here, we leveraged biased small molecule activators of PP2A (SMAPs) to explore the role of B56-PP2A(s) in 4E-BP regulation and the potential of B56-PP2A activation for restoring translational control in tumors. SMAP treatment promoted PP2A-dependent hypophosphorylation of 4E-BP1/2, supporting a role for B56-PP2As (e.g., B56α-PP2A) as 4E-BP phosphatases. Unexpectedly, SMAPs induced transcriptional upregulation of 4E-BP1 through a B56 PP2A→TFE3/TFEB→ATF4 axis. Cap-binding and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that B56-PP2A(s) activation blocks assembly of the eIF4F translation initiation complex, and cap-dependent translation assays confirmed the translation inhibitory effects of SMAPs. Thus, B56-PP2A(s) orchestrate a translation repressive program involving transcriptional induction and activation of 4E-BP1. Notably, SMAPs promoted 4E-BP1-dependent apoptosis in tumor cells and potentiated 4E-BP1 function in the presence of ERK or mTOR inhibitors, agents that rely on inhibition of eIF4E-dependent translation for antitumor activity. These findings, combined with the ability of SMAPs to regulate 4E-BP1 in vivo, highlight the potential of PP2A activators for cancer therapy and overcoming therapy resistance."

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess whether spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) application procedures (ie, target, thrust, and region) impacted changes in pain and disability for adults with spine pain. DESIGN: Systematic review with network meta-analysis. LITERATURE SEARCH: We searched PubMed and Epistemonikos for systematic reviews indexed up to February 2022 and conducted a systematic search of 5 databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL [Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials], PEDro [Physiotherapy Evidence Database], and Index to Chiropractic Literature) from January 1, 2018, to September 12, 2023. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from recent systematic reviews and newly identified RCTs published during the review process and employed artificial intelligence to identify potentially relevant articles not retrieved through our electronic database searches. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs of the effects of high-velocity, low-amplitude SMT, compared to other SMT approaches, interventions, or controls, in adults with spine pain. DATA SYNTHESIS: The outcomes were spinal pain intensity and disability measured at short-term (end of treatment) and long-term (closest to 12 months) follow-ups. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using version 2 of the Cochrane RoB tool. Results were presented as network plots, evidence rankings, and league tables. RESULTS: We included 161 RCTs (11 849 participants). Most SMT procedures were equal to clinical guideline interventions and were slightly more effective than other treatments. When comparing inter-SMT procedures, effects were small and not clinically relevant. A general and nonspecific rather than a specific and targeted SMT approach had the highest probability of achieving the largest effects. Results were based on very low- to low-certainty evidence, mainly downgraded owing to large within-study heterogeneity, high RoB, and an absence of direct comparisons. CONCLUSION: There was low-certainty evidence that clinicians could apply SMT according to their preferences and the patients' preferences and comfort. Differences between SMT approaches appear small and likely not clinically relevant. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2025;55(2):1-14. Epub 7 January 2025. https://doi.org/10.2519/jospt.2025.12707."

This study aims to determine the genomic characteristics of MRSA using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from medical centers in Mexico and to explore the associations between antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors.\nMethods: This study included 27 clinical isolates collected from sterile sites at eight centers in Mexico in 2022 and 2023. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using VITEK 2. In addition, WGS was performed using a NovaSeq platform, and a bioinformatic analysis was conducted using several tools.\nResults: In this study, 21 strains were CC5, five were CC8, and one was CC93. Moreover, six strains were identified as ST5(CC5)-MRSA-IIa- t895, four strains were found to be ST1011(CC5)-MRSA-IIa-t895, five strains were found to be ST1011(CC5)-MRSA-IIa-t9364, one strain was found to be ST1011(CC5)-MRSA-IIa-t8116, another was found to be ST1011(CC5)-MRSA-IIa-t62, three were found to be ST8(CC8)-MRSA-IVa-t8, one strain was ST5(CC5)-MRSA-IVa-t2, one strain was as ST93(CC93)-MRSA-IVa-t3949, two strains were ST9003(CC8)-MRSA-IVa-t18492, and three strains were ST9034(CC5)-MRSA-V-t2. All SCCmec IIa strains showed resistance to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and all but two strains were resistant to clindamycin. Among the strains that harbored the type IIa cassette, most had the aadD, blaZ, and ermA_SDS genes and the erm A gene. Multiple genes for adhesion, enzymes, immune evasion, and secretion system were detected, regardless of SCCmec type. Of the SCCmec IVa strains, most harbored the Panton-Valentine leukocidin encoding genes.\nConclusion: In this study, the most frequently detected CC was CC5, followed by CC8, and CC93, and the most frequently detected MRSA ST was ST1011, followed by ST5. Most SCCmec elements were found to be type IIa, followed by type IVa. High MIC values were observed for ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, and clindamycin, particularly within SCCmec IIa. Of the SCCmec IVa strains, most harbored the lukS-PV and lukF-PV genes."

    "abstract": "Lenacapavir (LEN) is a highly potent, long-acting antiretroviral medication for treating people infected with muti-drug-resistant HIV-1 phenotypes. The inhibitor targets multifaceted functions of the viral capsid protein (CA) during HIV-1 replication. Previous studies have mainly focused on elucidating LEN's mode of action during viral ingress. Additionally, the inhibitor has been shown to interfere with mature capsid assembly during viral egress. However, the mechanism for how LEN affects HIV-1 maturation is unknown. Here, we show that pharmacologically relevant LEN concentrations do not impair proteolytic processing of Gag in virions. Instead, we have elucidated the primary mechanism for highly potent inhibition of HIV-1 maturation by sub-stoichiometric LEN:CA ratios. The inhibitor exerts opposing effects on formation of CA pentamers versus hexamers, the key capsomere intermediates in mature capsid assembly. LEN impairs formation of pentamers, whereas it induces assembly of hexameric lattices by imposing an opened CA conformation and stabilizing a dimeric form of CA. Consequently, LEN treatment results in morphologically atypical virus particles containing malformed, hyper-stable CA assemblies, which fail to infect target cells. Moreover, we have uncovered an inverse correlation between inhibitor potency and CA levels in cell culture assays, which accounts for LEN's ability to potently (with picomolar EC50 values) inhibit HIV-1 maturation at clinically relevant drug concentrations."

    "abstract": "We have demonstrated that the cellular protein M-Sec promotes the transmission of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show how HTLV-1 utilizes M-Sec for its efficient transmission. HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells expressed M-Sec at a higher level than uninfected CD4+ T cells. The ex vivo culture of the infected cells upregulated the expression of M-Sec, the level of which was sustained for a long time. The viral structural protein Gag is distributed in a punctate pattern in cells. M-Sec promoted the accumulation of large intracellular Gag puncta. This accumulation was dependent on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), since it was lost upon the removal of PIP2 binding motifs in M-Sec or the depletion of cellular PIP2. The viral envelope protein Env co-localized with the large Gag puncta induced by M-Sec. Furthermore, viral particles produced by M-Sec-expressing cells contained a higher amount of Env. Given that M-Sec alters the cellular distribution of PIP2, these results suggest that M-Sec promotes the formation of infectious viral particles through PIP2. Since the expression of M-Sec is mediated by HTLV-1 Tax protein, M-Sec appears to function in a positive feedback loop that ensures efficient HTLV-1 transmission."

    "abstract": "The intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii manipulates host cell signaling to avoid targeting by autophagosomes and lysosomal degradation. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a mediator of this survival strategy. However, EGFR expression is limited in the brain and retina, organs affected in toxoplasmosis. This raises the possibility that T. gondii activates a signaling mechanism independently of EGFR to avoid autophagic targeting. We report T. gondii activates Src to promote parasite survival even in cells that lack EGFR. Blockade of Src triggered LC3 and LAMP-1 recruitment around the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and parasite killing dependent on the autophagy protein, ULK1, and lysosomal enzymes. Src promoted PI3K activation and recruitment of activated Akt to the PV membrane. T. gondii promoted Src association with PTEN, and PTEN phosphorylation at Y240, S380, T382, and T383, hallmarks of an inactive PTEN conformation known to maintain Akt activation. Blockade of parasite killing was dependent of activated Akt. Src knockdown or treatment with the Src family kinase inhibitor, Saracatinib, impaired these events, leading to PTEN accumulation around the PV and a reduction in activated Akt recruitment at this site. Saracatinib treatment in mice with pre-established cerebral and ocular toxoplasmosis promoted PTEN recruitment around tachyzoites in neural tissue impairing recruitment of activated Akt, profoundly reducing parasite load and neural histopathology that were dependent of the autophagy protein, Beclin 1. Our studies uncovered an EGFR-independent pathway activated by T. gondii that enables its survival and is central to the development of neural toxoplasmosis."

If it cannot be made available to this population, then the vaccine should be prioritised for individuals aged ≥75 years and those aged ≥50 years with risk factors. The vaccine should preferably be given between September and November and can be co-administered with the influenza vaccine.

    "abstract": "The somato-cognitive action network (SCAN) consists of three nodes interspersed within Penfield's motor effector regions. The configuration of the somato-cognitive action network nodes resembles the one of the 'plis de passage' of the central sulcus: small gyri bridging the precentral and postcentral gyri. Thus, we hypothesize that these may provide a structural substrate of the somato-cognitive action network. Here, using microdissections of sixteen human hemispheres, we consistently identified a chain of three distinct plis de passage with increased underlying white matter, in locations analogous to the somato-cognitive action network nodes. We mapped localizations of plis de passage into standard stereotactic space to seed fMRI connectivity across 9,000 resting-state fMRI scans, which demonstrated the connectivity of these sites with the somato-cognitive action network. Intraoperative recordings during direct electrical central sulcus stimulation further identified inter-effector regions corresponding to plis de passage locations. This work provides a critical step towards improved understanding of the somato-cognitive action network in both structural and functional terms. Further, our work has the potential to guide the development of refined motor cortex stimulation techniques for treating brain disorders, and operative resective techniques for complex surgery of the motor cortex."

Pain, pruritus, malodor, and suppuration have a significant impact on quality of life for HS patients. Prevalence figures vary greatly in the literature from 0.05% to 4.1%, and HS is more common in females. The current understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of HS is incomplete; numerous hypotheses concern the interplay of lifestyle factors, skin microbiota, genetics, and a dysregulated immune system. Due to its phenotypic heterogeneity and multifactorial pathogenesis, HS is a complex disease that can prove challenging to manage. Two approved biologic therapies for the management of HS have led to clinical response in approximately 50% of treated patients. New therapies targeting the interleukin (IL)-1, IL-17, IL-36, and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways are in ongoing clinical trials, and preliminary data offer hope for greater clinical efficacy in HS in the future."

This study aimed to investigate the association of nine different obesity-related indicators (BRI, RFM, BMI, WC, LAP, CMI, VAI, AIP, TyG) with gallstones and to compare their predictive properties for screening gallstones.\nMethods: Data for this study were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the 2017-2020 cycle, and weighted logistic regression analyses with multi-model adjustment were conducted to explore the association of the nine indicators with gallstones. Subject working curves were analyzed to assess the screening ability of the nine indicators. In addition, the association between the most predictive indicator and gallstones was investigated with smooth curve fitting, and differences in risk across populations were explored with subgroup analyses.\nResults: In total, 3654 participants were involved in the final analysis and 383 (10.48%) carried gallstones. The results of weighted multifactorial logistic regression analysis indicated that BRI, RFM, BMI, WC, LAP, and CMI were independent risk factors for gallstones. The ORs for the highest quartile were 4.13 for RFM, 3.13 for BRI, 2.85 for BMI, 2.86 for WC, 2.45 for LAP, and 1.49 for CMI. The area under the ROC curve for RFM was 0.70. The Delong test compared the performance of different ROCs and revealed that the difference between the area under the curve of RFM and the other metrics was significant (P < 0.05). Smooth curve fitting suggested a linear positive correlation between RFM and gallstones (LLR > 0.05), especially in women, non-Hispanic White, insufficient physical activity, hypertensive, and diabetic populations.\nConclusion: RFM, BRI, BMI, WC, LAP, and CMI were essential indicators for recognizing gallstones. By comparison, we realized that RFM was a better predictor of gallstones."

The goal of this study was to evaluate the AA morphology of patients who had TF-TAVR using an artificial intelligence algorithm and then to evaluate its predictive value for clinical outcomes.\nMaterials and methods: A total of 1480 consecutive patients undergoing TF-TAVR using a new-generation transcatheter heart valve at 12 institutes were included in this retrospective study. The AA measurements were evaluated by deep learning, and then the approach index (IA) was determined. The machine learning algorithm was used to construct the predictive model and was validated externally.\nResults: The area under the curve of the IA model using random forest and logistic regression was 0.675 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.586-0.764] and 0.757 (95% CI: 0.665-0.849), respectively. The IA model was validated externally, and consistent distinctions were obtained. After we used a generalized propensity score matching method for continuous exposure, the IA was the strongest correlation factor for major procedural events (odds ratio: 3.87; 95% CI: 2.13-7.59, P < 0.001). When leaflet morphology or transcatheter heart valve type was an interactive item with IA, neither of them was statistically significant in terms of clinical outcomes.\nConclusion: IA may be used to identify the impact of AA morphology on procedural and clinical outcomes in patients having TF-TAVR and to help to predict the procedural complications."

    "abstract": "Background: Understanding based on up-to-date data on the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is limited, especially regarding how subtypes contribute to the overall NCD burden and the attributable risk factors across locations and subtypes. We aimed to report the global, regional, and national burden of NCDs, subtypes, and attributable risk factors in 2021, and trends from 1990 to 2021 by age, sex, and socio-demographic index (SDI).\nMaterials and methods: We used data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 to estimate the prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for NCDs and subtypes, along with attributable risk factors. Estimates were presented with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI). Relationships between NCD DALYs and SDI across regions and countries were estimated using smoothing splines models.\nResults: In 2021, NCDs accounted for 7.3 trillion global cases, 43.8 million deaths, and 1.73 billion DALYs. Global age-standardized rates showed NCD prevalence at 91 034.0, deaths at 529.7, and DALYs at 20 783.0 per 100 000 population, with changes of -0.1%, -27.9%, and -19.4% from 1990, respectively. Subtypes with the highest age-standardized DALYs were cardiovascular disease (5056), neoplasms (2954), and other NCDs (1913 per 100 000 population), with diabetes and kidney diseases increasing by 25.6% since 1990. Regionally, Oceania had the highest age-standardized DALYs (28 782.0) in 2021, while Southern Sub-Saharan Africa saw the largest increase (+8.0%) since 1990. Nationally, Nauru reported the highest age-standardized DALYs (42 754.3), with Lesotho experiencing the largest increase since 1990 (+38.4%). Cardiovascular diseases had the highest age-standardized DALYs among subtypes across 16 of 21 regions and 159 of 204 countries. Key risk factors globally were high systolic blood pressure (contributing to 12.8% of age-standardized DALYs), dietary risks (10.0%), and tobacco usage (9.9%), with the most significant increase in high body-mass index (+57.8%). High systolic blood pressure was the biggest attributable risk factor for NCDs in 9 regions and 101 countries. Age-standardized data reveal higher NCD prevalence in women and greater mortality and DALYs in men, with DALYs spiking post-45 for both sexes. Men have higher DALYs attributed to most risk factors, excluding those from unsafe sex, intimate partner violence, low physical activity, and high body-mass index. Age-standardized DALYs of NCDs generally decline with the SDI spectrum. Dominant NCD risk factors follow gender-age and SDI-based trajectories.\nConclusion: Despite declining age-standardized prevalence, death rates, and DALYs for NCDs, they remain a major health issue. Emphasis on managing cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, kidney diseases, and mental disorders is essential. The burden of NCDs is more severe in low-SDI countries and among males. Prevention efforts should prioritize blood pressure control, dietary improvements, and tobacco reduction, tailoring interventions according to gender-age-based and SDI-development-based trajectories of dominant risk factors."

Understanding relative disease severity can help to inform vaccination guidance.\nObjective: To compare disease severity of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV among US veterans.\nDesign, setting, and participants: This retrospective cohort study analyzed national US Veterans Health Administration electronic health record data of nonhospitalized veterans who underwent same-day testing for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV, and were diagnosed with a single infection between August 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023, or between August 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024.\nExposures: Infection with SARS-CoV-2, influenza, or RSV.\nMain outcomes and measures: Following inverse probability weighting, the cumulative incidence and risk differences (RDs) were calculated for the primary outcomes of 30-day hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and death, as well as the secondary outcome of long-term death extending through 180 days.\nResults: Among 68 581 patients included in the 2022 to 2023 cohort (6239 [9.1%] with RSV, 16 947 [24.7%] with influenza, and 45 395 [66.2%] with COVID-19) and 72 939 in the 2023 to 2024 cohort (9748 [13.4%] with RSV, 19 242 [26.4%] with influenza, and 43 949 [60.3%] with COVID-19), the median (IQR) age was 66 (53-75) years, and 123 090 (87.0%) were male. During the 2023 to 2024 season, the 30-day risk of hospitalization was similar for COVID-19 (16.2%) and influenza (16.3%) but lower for RSV at 14.3% (RD for COVID-19 vs RSV, 1.9% [95% CI, 0.9%-2.9%]; RD for influenza vs RSV, 2.0% [95% CI, 0.8%-3.3%]). The 30-day risk of death during the 2022 to 2023 season was slightly higher for COVID-19 (1.0%) compared with influenza (0.7%) (RD, 0.4% [95% CI, 0.1%-0.6%]) or RSV (0.7%) (RD, 0.4% [95% CI, 0.1%-0.6%]) but similar during the 2023 to 2024 season. Mortality risk at 180 days was higher for COVID-19 during both seasons (2023-2024 RD for COVID-19 vs influenza, 0.8% [95% CI, 0.3%-1.2%]; RD for COVID-19 vs RSV, 0.6% [95% CI, 0.1%-1.1%]). Higher mortality in both seasons was observed for veterans without COVID-19 vaccination in the previous year compared to veterans without seasonal influenza vaccination. In contrast, among groups vaccinated against their respective infections, there were no mortality differences at any time point between COVID-19 and influenza.\nConclusions and relevance: This cohort study showed that, during the 2022 to 2023 season, infection with SARS-CoV-2 was associated with more severe disease outcomes than influenza or RSV, whereas differences were less pronounced during the 2023 to 2024 season. During both seasons, RSV remained a milder illness, whereas COVID-19 was associated with higher long-term mortality. Vaccination attenuated differences in disease severity and long-term mortality."

All 5 rules performed similarly across all 3 cohorts.\nConclusions and relevance: In this prognostic study, 5 termination of resuscitation rules were developed and validated for in-hospital cardiac arrest. The best performing rule had a low false-positive rate and a reasonable positive rate in all national cohorts. These termination of resuscitation rules may aid decision-making during resuscitation."

    "abstract": "Importance: In the Atrial Cardiopathy and Antithrombotic Drugs in Prevention After Cryptogenic Stroke (ARCADIA) randomized clinical trial, anticoagulation did not prevent recurrent stroke among patients with a recent cryptogenic stroke and atrial cardiopathy. It is unknown whether anticoagulation prevents covert infarcts in this population.\nObjective: To test the use of apixaban vs aspirin for prevention of nonlacunar covert infarcts after cryptogenic stroke in patients with atrial cardiopathy.\nDesign, setting, and participants: ARCADIA-MRI, an ancillary study to the ARCADIA trial with a median follow-up period of 27 months, enrolled participants from 75 sites in the US from November 14, 2019, until December 2, 2022. Participants in ARCADIA were invited to coenroll in ARCADIA-MRI if they had not permanently discontinued the study drug and had no contraindications on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 310 (31%) of the 1015 ARCADIA participants enrolled in ARCADIA-MRI and of those 174 (56%) with adequate quality baseline and follow-up MRI were included in the present analyses.\nInterventions: MRI performed at the time of the index stroke served as the baseline image unless it was unavailable or of insufficient quality, in which case a new research MRI was obtained. A follow-up research MRI was performed upon each participant's completion of participation in the ARCADIA parent study.\nMain outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was incident nonlacunar covert infarct on the follow-up MRI assessed by 2 independent raters who were masked to treatment assignment.\nResults: Baseline characteristics were balanced between the apixaban (n = 79) and aspirin (n = 95) arms. The mean (SD) age was 66 (10.6) years, and the median (IQR) modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 1 (0-2). Ninety-one participants (52.3%) were male. During the median (IQR) follow-up of 811 (487-1288) days, the risk of incident nonlacunar covert infarcts was lower in the apixaban group (5.1%) than the aspirin group (17.9%) (weighted relative risk, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10-0.83).\nConclusions and relevance: Apixaban compared to aspirin was associated with fewer incident nonlacunar covert infarcts among a subset of patients with a recent cryptogenic ischemic stroke and atrial cardiopathy who were enrolled in ARCADIA.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03192215."

Participants included children diagnosed with crush syndrome after the 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquake, and eligibility criteria included age, diagnosis, and need for KRT. Data were analyzed from August to October 2024.\nExposure: Children diagnosed with crush syndrome who underwent KRT.\nMain outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was dialysis dependency at discharge. Secondary outcomes included LOS in the PICU.\nResults: The study included 183 pediatric patients (median [IQR] age, 158 (108-192) months; 49 [54.4%] males) with earthquake-related injury, of whom 90 required KRT. The median (IQR) time under the rubble was 25.7 (1-137) hours. At admission, 51 patients (56.6%) had stage 3 acute kidney injury, and the median (IQR) serum creatinine phosphokinase level was 15 555 (9386-59 274) IU/L. There was a significant association between the Kidney Disease-Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage at admission and serum creatinine phosphokinase level (area under the curve, 0.750; 95% CI, 0.621-0.879; P < .001). Among patients undergoing KRT, 33 (36.7%) received continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration, and 23 (25.6%) underwent intermittent hemodialysis (IHD). IHD treatment was the only independent factor associated with shorter PICU LOS (odds ratio [OR], 6.87; 95% CI, 1.54-30.67; P = .01). The dialysis dependency at discharge was higher in children who were transferred late to the PICU (β = 0.003; 95% CI, 0.001-0.005; P < .001) and those with a high Pediatric Trauma Score (β = 0.022; 95% CI, 0.003-0.041; P = 02). IHD was not statistically significantly associated with remaining dialysis-dependent at discharge (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 0.53-8.98; P = .28). The overall mortality rate in the cohort was 6 patients (6.6%).\nConclusions and relevance: This cohort study found that children who were transferred late to intensive care and those with a high trauma score after earthquake-related crush injury were more likely to remain dialysis-dependent at discharge. Furthermore, KDIGO stage at admission was associated with elevated serum creatinine phosphokinase levels. These findings highlight the critical importance of early intervention and appropriate treatment in children with AKI following prolonged entrapment."

Research is needed to understand trends by social and geographic factors.\nObjective: To examine trends in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates in California by stage, age, race and ethnicity, and region.\nDesign, setting, and participants: This cohort study used mortality data from the California Cancer Registry and California Department of Public Health's Center for Health Statistics, and incidence data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and the US Census. The dataset for these analyses was released in April 2024. Participants included males residing in California between 2004 and 2021. Analyses were conducted from April to October 2024.\nExposures: Stage at diagnosis, age, race and ethnicity, and region of California.\nMain outcomes and measures: The delay-adjusted incidence rates and mortality rates were calculated and age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population. Annual percentage changes (APC) were calculated using NCI's Joinpoint Regression Program.\nResults: Between 2004 and 2021, there were 387 636 prostate cancer cases (27 938 distant stage) and 58 754 prostate cancer deaths in California. In this study, 203 038 cases (52.4%) occurred among males aged 55 to 69 years, and 153 884 (39.7%) occurred among males 70 years or older. The distribution of race and ethnicity among cases was: 1031 American Indian or Alaska Native (0.3%); 31 366 Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (8.1%); 66 695 Hispanic or Latino (17.2%); 36 808 non-Hispanic Black (9.5%); 238 229 non-Hispanic White (61.5%); and 13 507 unknown or other races (3.5%). On average, the incidence of distant prostate cancer increased 6.7% (95% CI, 6.2% to 7.3%) per year between 2011 and 2021. By race and ethnicity, the APC ranged from 6.5% (95% CI, 4.2% to 13.4%) among Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander males between 2011 and 2021 to 8.0% (95% CI, 6.9% to 9.5%) among Hispanic males between 2014 and 2021. In 9 of the 10 California regions, the incidence of distant prostate cancer increased by approximately 6% or more per year. Prostate cancer mortality rates declined 2.6% per year between 2004 and 2012 but plateaued between 2012 to 2021 (APC, 0.1%; 95% CI, -0.6% to 1.6%). The plateau in mortality occurred across ages, races and ethnicities, and regions.\nConclusions and relevance: In this cohort study among California residents, the incidence of distant stage prostate cancer increased throughout the state between 2011 and 2021. Mortality rates plateaued between 2012 and 2021, ending previous decades of decline. Implementation of more effective prostate cancer screening strategies are critically needed."

    "abstract": "Importance: Patients undergoing unplanned abdominal surgical procedures are at increased risk of surgical site infection (SSI). It is not known if incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) can reduce SSI rates in this setting.\nObjective: To evaluate the effectiveness of iNPWT in reducing the rate of SSI in adults undergoing emergency laparotomy with primary skin closure.\nDesign, setting, and participants: SUNRRISE was an assessor-masked, pragmatic, phase 3, individual-participant, randomized clinical trial. Adult patients undergoing emergency laparotomy in 22 hospitals in the UK and 12 hospitals in Australia between December 18, 2018, and May 25, 2021, were recruited. Patients were followed up for 30 days postprocedure; database closure was on August 25, 2021.\nInterventions: Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive iNPWT (n = 411), which involved a specialized dressing used to create negative pressure over the closed wound vs the surgeon's choice of wound dressing (n = 410). Randomization and dressing application occurred in the operating room at the end of the surgical procedure.\nMain outcomes and measures: The primary outcome measure was SSI up to 30 days postprocedure, evaluated by an assessor masked to the randomized allocation and using criteria from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 7 secondary outcomes, including length of hospital stay, postoperative complications up to 30 days, hospital readmission for wound-related complications within 30 days, wound pain, and quality of life.\nResults: A total of 840 patients were randomized (536 from the UK; 304 from Australia). Overall, 52% were female; the mean age was 63.8 (range, 18.8 to 95.3) years. After postrandomization exclusions (N = 52), 394 participants per group were included in the primary analysis. The number of participants who had an SSI in the iNPWT group was 112 of 394 (28.4%), compared with 108 of 394 (27.4%) in the surgeon's preference group (relative risk, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.83-1.28]; P = .78). This finding was consistent across the preplanned subgroup analyses, including degree of contamination, presence of a stoma, participant body mass index, and skin preparation used, and across all preplanned sensitivity analyses. Of 7 secondary outcomes, 6 showed no significant difference, including hospital readmission, quality of life, and hospital stay (median [IQR], 8 [6-14] days in the iNPWT group and 9 [6-14.5] days in the surgeon's preference group [ratio of geometric means, 0.96 (95% CI, 0.88-1.06); P = .21]).\nConclusions and relevance: Routine application of iNPWT to the closed surgical wound after emergency laparotomy did not prevent SSI more than other dressings.\nTrial registration: isrctn.com Identifier: ISRCTN17599457; anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12619000496112."

    "abstract": "Importance: Essential thrombocythemia, a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm with excessive platelet production, is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and bleeding. The annual incidence rate of essential thrombocythemia in the US is 1.5/100 000 persons.\nObservations: Patients with essential thrombocythemia have a persistent platelet count of 450 × 109/L or greater. The differential diagnosis includes myeloproliferative neoplasms (polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis, chronic myeloid leukemia); inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus; infections; splenectomy; iron deficiency anemia; and solid tumors such as lung cancer. Approximately 90% of individuals with essential thrombocythemia have genetic variants that upregulate the JAK-STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5) signaling pathway, including Janus kinase 2 (JAK2, 64%), calreticulin (CALR, 23%), and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL, 4%). The median age at diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia is 59 years. The median overall survival exceeds 35 years in those diagnosed at 40 years or younger. Patients with essential thrombocythemia are at increased risk of arterial thrombosis (11%), venous thrombosis (7%), and hemorrhagic complications (8%). Thrombosis risk is increased among those with a history of thrombosis, age older than 60 years, a JAK2 gene variant, and cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemias, tobacco use). Use of aspirin (81-100 mg/d) is suggested for most patients with essential thrombocythemia to lower thrombosis risk. In a retrospective study of 300 affected patients with a low thrombosis risk (younger than 60 years with no prior thrombosis), those not taking aspirin (100 mg/d) had a risk of arterial thrombosis of 9.4/1000 patient-years and a venous thrombosis risk of 8.2/1000 patient years; cardiovascular risk factors were associated with a higher risk of arterial thrombi (incidence rate ratio, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.02-6.1]), and a JAK2 gene variant was associated with increased risk of venous thrombosis (incidence rate ratio, 4.0 [95% CI, 1.2-12.9]). In a randomized trial of 114 patients at higher risk for thrombosis (age older than 60 years or a prior thrombotic event), cytoreduction with hydroxyurea significantly lowered the risk of arterial or venous thrombotic events compared with no cytoreductive therapy (3.6% vs 24%; P < .01). At a median of 8.5 years from diagnosis, approximately 10% of patients with essential thrombocythemia develop myelofibrosis and about 3% develop acute myeloid leukemia.\nConclusions: Essential thrombocythemia is a rare clonal myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with an increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis, hemorrhage, myelofibrosis, and acute myeloid leukemia. Based on individual risk factors for thrombosis, persons with essential thrombocythemia may be treated with low-dose aspirin, either alone or in combination with a cytoreductive drug such as hydroxyurea."

Participants were healthy adults aged 18 to 44 years with no history of chronic pain or a neurological or psychiatric condition. Participants experienced a model of prolonged temporomandibular pain with outcomes collected over 30 days. Electroencephalography to assess PAF and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess CME were recorded on days 0, 2, and 5. Pain was assessed twice daily from days 1 through 30.\nExposure: Participants received an injection of nerve growth factor (NGF) to the right masseter muscle on days 0 and 2 to induce prolonged temporomandibular pain lasting up to 4 weeks.\nMain outcomes and measures: The predictive accuracy of the PAF/CME biomarker signature was determined using a nested control-test scheme: machine learning models were run on a training set (n = 100), where PAF and CME were predictors and pain sensitivity was the outcome. The winning classifier was assessed on a test set (n = 50) comparing the predicted pain labels against the true labels.\nResults: Among the final sample of 150 participants, 66 were female and 84 were male; the mean (SD) age was 25.1 (6.2) years. The winning classifier was logistic regression, with an outstanding area under the curve (AUC = 1.00). The locked model assessed on the test set had excellent performance (AUC = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.99). Results were reproduced across a range of methodological parameters. Moreover, inclusion of sex and pain catastrophizing as covariates did not improve model performance, suggesting the model including biomarkers only was more robust. PAF and CME biomarkers showed good to excellent test-retest reliability.\nConclusions and relevance: This study provides evidence for a sensorimotor cortical biomarker signature for pain sensitivity. The combination of accuracy, reproducibility, and reliability suggests the PAF/CME biomarker signature has substantial potential for clinical translation, including predicting the transition from acute to chronic pain."

Their comparative effectiveness remains uncertain, leading to worldwide practice variation. Nephrotic syndrome is the most common kidney disease managed by pediatricians globally and suboptimal treatment is associated with high morbidity.\nObjective: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of cyclophosphamide vs calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) for childhood nephrotic syndrome relapse prevention.\nDesign, setting, and participants: Using target trial emulation methods, the study team emulated a pragmatic, open-label clinical trial using available data from the Insight Into Nephrotic Syndrome: Investigating Genes, Health, and Therapeutics (INSIGHT) study. INSIGHT is a multicenter, prospective cohort study in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. Participants included children (1 to 18 years) with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome diagnosed between 1996 and 2019 from the Greater Toronto Area, who initiated cyclophosphamide or a calcineurin inhibitor treatment. Data analysis was performed in 2024.\nExposures: Incident cyclophosphamide or calcineurin inhibitor treatment. Randomization was emulated by overlap weighting of propensity scores for treatment assignment.\nMain outcomes: The primary outcome was time to relapse, analyzed by weighted Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Secondary outcomes included relapse rates, subsequent immunosuppression, kidney function, hypertension, adverse events, and quality of life.\nResults: Of 578 children (median age at diagnosis, 3.7 [IQR, 2.8-6.0] years; 371 male [64%] and 207 female [36%]), 252 initiated cyclophosphamide, 131 initiated calcineurin inhibitors, and 87 sequentially initiated both medications. Baseline characteristics were well balanced after propensity score weighting. During median 5.5-year (quarter 1 to quarter 3, 2.5-9.2) follow-up, there was no significant difference in time to relapse between calcineurin inhibitor vs cyclophosphamide treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% CI, 0.84-1.87). Relapses were more common after calcineurin inhibitor treatment than cyclophosphamide (85% vs 73%) in the weighted cohorts, but not statistically significant. There were also no significant differences in subsequent relapse rates, nonsteroid immunosuppression use, or kidney function between medications. Calcineurin inhibitor treatment was associated with more hospitalizations (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.14-2.92) and intravenous albumin use (HR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.65-4.81).\nConclusions and relevance: In this study, there was no evidence of difference in time to relapse after cyclophosphamide and calcineurin inhibitor treatment in children with nephrotic syndrome. Cyclophosphamide treatment is shorter in duration and more accessible globally than calcineurin inhibitors."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Receptor CUB-domain containing- protein 1 (CDCP1) was evaluated as a target for detection and treatment of breast cancer.\nExperimental design: CDCP1 expression was assessed immunohistochemically in tumors from 423 patients (119 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); 75 HER2+; 229 ER+/HER2- including 228 primary tumors, 229 lymph node and 47 distant metastases). Cell cytotoxicity induced in vitro by a CDCP1-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), consisting of the human/mouse chimeric antibody ch10D7 and the microtubule disruptor monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), was quantified, including in combination with HER2-targeting ADC T-DM1. Detection of CDCP1-expressing primary and metastatic xenografts in mice was examined by PET-CT imaging using 89zirconium-labelled ch10D7 (89Zr-ch10D7). The impact of ch10D7-MMAE on tumor burden and survival in vivo, including in combination with T-DM1, was quantified in cell line and patient-derived xenograft mouse models.\nResults: CDCP1 is expressed predominantly on the surface of malignant cells of 70% of TNBCs, 80% of HER2+ tumors, and increases in ER+/HER2- tumors from 44.9% in primary tumors to 56.4% in lymph node metastases and 74.3% in distant metastases. PET-CT imaging with 89Zr-ch10D7 is effective for the detection of primary and metastatic CDCP1-expressing TNBCs in mice. ADC ch10D7-MMAE kills CDCP1-expressing cells in vitro and controls primary and metastatic TNBC xenografts in mice, conferring significant survival advantages over chemotherapy. It compares favorably to T-DM1 in vivo, and ch10D7-MMAE combined with T-DM1 showed the most potent efficacy, markedly reducing tumor burden of CDCP1+/HER2+ xenografts and prolonging mouse survival, compared with T-DM1 or ch10D7.\nConclusions: CDCP1-directed molecular imaging has potential to identify aggressive breast cancers for CDCP1-targeted treatment."

    "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system (ECS), regulating such processes as energy homeostasis, inflammation, and muscle function, centers around cannabinoid receptors, including CB1. These receptors are mainly located in the central nervous system and skeletal muscles. Hyperactivity of CB1 receptors is linked to metabolic disorders and chronic inflammation, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets for muscle hypertrophy and metabolic health. This systematic review, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023462735), follows PRISMA-P guidelines and uses the PICO framework. It evaluates the effects of CB1 receptor antagonism on muscle hypertrophy in animal models and cell lines. Interventions include pharmacological antagonists, genetic modifications, and exercise-induced antagonism. A comprehensive search of databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus, supplemented by gray literature and reference lists, yielded 571 references. From these, ten studies were selected, involving 338 rodents, using CB1 antagonists like rimonabant and AM251. The findings suggest that CB1 receptor antagonism enhances insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, reduces body fat, and promotes muscle growth through pathways such as PI3K/Akt and mTOR, as well as by improving autophagy and mitochondrial function. This review proposes CB1 receptor antagonism as a promising approach for enhancing muscle hypertrophy and improving metabolic health, with potential applications in treating such conditions as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and sarcopenia. Future research should aim to standardize intervention protocols and explore integrated therapies to fully harness the benefits of CB1 modulation."

    "abstract": "The word \"cancer\" evokes myriad emotions, ranging from fear and despair to hope and determination. Cancer is aptly defined as a complex and multifaceted group of diseases that has unapologetically led to the loss of countless lives and affected innumerable families across the globe. The battle with cancer is not only a physical battle, but also an emotional, as well as a psychological skirmish for patients and for their loved ones. Cancer has been a part of our history, stories, and lives for centuries and has challenged the ingenuity of health and medical science, and the resilience of the human spirit. From the early days of surgery and radiation therapy to cutting-edge developments in chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapy, and targeted treatments, the medical field continues to make significant headway in the fight against cancer. However, even after all these advancements, cancer is still among the leading cause of death globally. This urges us to understand the central hallmarks of neoplastic cells to identify novel molecular targets for the development of promising therapeutic approaches. Growing research suggests that stress mediators, including epinephrine, play a critical role in the development and progression of cancer by inducing neoplastic features through activating adrenergic receptors, particularly β-adrenoreceptors. Further, our experimental data has also shown that epinephrine mediates the growth of T-cell lymphoma by inducing proliferation, glycolysis, and apoptosis evasion via altering the expression levels of key regulators of these vital cellular processes. The beauty of receptor-based therapy lies in its precision and higher therapeutic value. Interestingly, the enhanced expression of β-adrenergic receptors (ADRBs), namely ADRB2 (β2-adrenoreceptor) and ADRB3 (β3-adrenoreceptor) has been noted in many cancers, such as breast, colon, gastric, pancreatic, and prostate and has been reported to play a pivotal role in facilitating cancer growth mainly by promoting proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, and chemoresistance. The present review article is an attempt to summarize the available findings which indicate a distinct relationship between stress hormones and cancer, with a special emphasis on epinephrine, considered as a key stress regulatory molecule. This article also discusses the possibility of using beta-blockers for cancer therapy."

    "abstract": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune disease characterised by exertion-induced muscle weakness that can lead to potentially life-threatening myasthenic crises. Detectable antibodies are directed against specific postsynaptic structures of the neuromuscular junction. MG is a chronic condition that can be improved through therapies, but to date, not cured. Standard treatment has been unchanged for decades and includes symptomatic treatment with acetylcholine-esterase inhibitors and disease-modifying treatment with steroids, steroid-sparing immunosuppressants and thymectomy. Overall, a relevant proportion of patients does not achieve a satisfactory clinical improvement under standard treatment. Additionally, long-term therapy with steroids can cause significant side effects and latency to clinical improvement with standard steroid-sparing immunosuppressants and after thymectomy can take months to years. In recent years, treatment of MG has changed fundamentally due to improved evidence from phase 3 trials and the regulatory approval of complement inhibitors and FcRn inhibitors as add-on treatment options. This provides new optimism for substantially more patients reaching minimal manifestation status and has led to a shift in treatment strategy with more targeted therapies being employed early in the course of the disease, especially in patients with high disease activity. In this focussed review, we provide an overview of the diagnosis, classification and standard treatment of MG, followed by data from randomised controlled trials on the modern drugs already available for therapy and those still in the final stages of clinical development. In the second part, we provide an overview of real-world data for already approved therapies and outline how the availability of new biologicals is changing both clinical decision-making and patient journey."

    "abstract": "Background and aims: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is prevalent worldwide and is difficult to eradicate. Current treatment strategies for chronic hepatitis B ultimately seek to achieve functional cure (FC); however, the factors contributing to FC remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the gut microbiota profiles of patients with chronic hepatitis B who achieved FC.\nMethods: Among 105 HBeAg-negative patients with chronic hepatitis B, 70 were enrolled, after excluding patients with cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma and those receiving nucleoside analogs. The gut microbiota of patients who achieved FC was assessed and compared with that of patients with high-titer of HBV DNA (HBV DNA ≥ 3.3 log IU/mL) or low-titer of HBV DNA (HBV DNA < 3.3 log IU/mL). Furthermore, we used cell culture-generated HBV (HBVcc) as a model for HBV infection to evaluate the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the identified bacteria.\nResults: There was no difference in the alpha or beta diversity of the gut microbiota between the FC group and the other groups. However, compared with the other groups, the FC group presented a greater relative abundance of bacteria that produce SCFAs, especially butyrate. In vitro studies demonstrated that 1.0 mM butyrate reduces HBsAg production in HBVcc-infected cells. Furthermore, butyrate administration was most effective at the post-HBV infection stage.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that butyrate-producing bacteria contribute to FC in HBeAg-negative patients with chronic hepatitis B through butyrate-mediated inhibition of HBV production."

When I was asked to write a manuscript about the SpA concept I felt honored. Thus, the purpose of this extensive review was, on the one hand, to describe the history of AS and axSpA, and on the other hand, to reason about the concept and the gestalt of axSpA, and finally to deliver some ideas what future researchers could possibly do to further study the disease.\nRecent findings: The last 3 decades were full of innovations for both, classification and treatment of axSpA which also helped us to learn about the pathophysiology. Thus, TNFa, IL-17, IL-23 and Janus kinase are established targets to reduce inflammation. IL-17 and IL-23 are very special in that regard because they both work for psoriasis but only anti-IL-17 agents which don't work in IBD are approved for axSpA, while IL 23 inhibitors are approved for both, psoriasis and IBD, but they don't work in axSpA. New imaging techniques such as low dose CT and synthetic MRI are likely to improve the detection of both active and structural lesions of axSpA. This manuscript tries to describe the most important findings about axSpA. The main aim of research remains to discover the pathophysiology and to further improve treatment options in order to reduce and abolish inflammation and prevent new bone formation to increase the quality of life of our patients. The differences between male and female disease and the role of the immune system in axSpA are now the main challenges, and the role of special T-cell receptors seem to deserve special interest."

    "heading": "Sex differences in the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids by adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in humans",
    "abstract": "Adult males and females have markedly different body composition, energy expenditure, and have different degrees of risk for metabolic diseases. A major aspect of metabolic regulation involves the appropriate storage and disposal of glucose and fatty acids. The use of sophisticated calorimetry, tracer, and imaging techniques have provided insight into the complex metabolism of these substrates showing that the regulation of these processes varies tremendously throughout the day, from the overnight fasting condition to meal ingestion, to the effects of physical activity. The sexual dimorphism in substrate metabolism is most readily observed in how fatty acids are stored and mobilized. The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive and critical summary of the reported sex-differences in the mobilization, oxidation and storage of fat and carbohydrate in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. We will describe how adipose tissue lipolysis differs between sexes, and how this varies between fed, fasted and exercise conditions. We will also review what is known about endogenous and exogenous fatty acid storage in adipose tissue and muscle, as well as how oxidation compares between men and women in response to exercise. What has been learned about the cellular level regulation of these processes will be described. Although glucose metabolism exhibits fewer differences between men and women, we will also review the existing knowledge on this topic."

    "abstract": "We investigated the effect of increasing the number of sets per week every fortnight versus performing a constant set volume on muscular adaptations over 12 weeks. Thirty females (RT experience 2.1 ± 1.0 years) were randomly assigned to a constant group (CG, n = 9) that performed 22 sets per week, a two-set progression group (2SG, n = 11), or a four-set progression group (4SG, n = 10). Forty-five degree leg press one-repetition maximum (1RM), vastus lateralis cross-sectional area (VL-CSA), and the sum of proximal, middle and distal lateral thigh muscle thickness (∑MT) were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. We observed that the 4SG and 2SG conditions showed greater improvements in 1RM than the CG (p < 0.001, p = 0.032, respectively), with no differences between 4SG and 2SG (p = 0.118). Regarding VL-CSA, the 4SG group showed greater increases than the CG (p = 0.029) but not than the 2SG (p = 0.263), whereas no differences between the 2SG and CG (p = 0.443) were observed. There were no differences between groups for ∑MT (p = 0.783). While all groups demonstrated improvements in the measured outcomes, our findings suggest that increasing weekly sets may offer additional benefits for 1RM and vastus lateralis cross-sectional area. However, no additional benefits were observed for ∑MT."

    "abstract": "Objective: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) can be treated with biological drugs targeting IL-17A, such as secukinumab, with good responses and long-term positive outcomes in clinical studies.\nMethods: An observational study was conducted on adult subjects with PsA and comorbidities, treated with secukinumab after prior therapy with conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or biological agents that were discontinued due to lack of efficacy or adverse drug reactions. Patients were followed up with clinical visits at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and evaluated for disease activity, pain, and quality of life, with respect to values recorded at baseline. Moreover, a narrative review of the literature was performed on secukinumab's use for PsA in real life.\nResults: Fifteen patients completed 6 months of follow-up, eleven patients completed 9 months, and six patients were followed for 12 months. The major comorbidities recorded were fibromyalgia (33% of patients), recurrent bilateral anterior uveitis, and autoimmune thyroiditis with hypothyroidism (both 13% of the patients). A significant improvement in Disease Activity Score-28 was recorded at 6 and 9 months, while a significant difference vs. baseline was seen at 3, 6, and 9 months for the Psoriasis Area Severity Index. The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index showed significant differences vs. baseline at 9 and 12 months. There was an improving trend at 9 and 12 months for pain scores and a significant improvement at 6 and 9 months for the physical component and at 12 months for the social component (Short Form 36 Health Survey quality of life scores). For the review of the literature, 35 articles were identified but only 17 papers were eventually considered.\nConclusions: Secukinumab has demonstrated effectiveness for PsA treatment in several real-world studies. Both patient-oriented and clinician-oriented outcomes showed a significant improvement with this treatment. The present real-world evaluation adds further evidence of the use of secukinumab for PsA treatment, showing the rapid, safe, clinically significant, and sustained responses of PsA patients affected by co-morbidities."

    "abstract": "Alba domain-containing proteins are ubiquitously found in archaea and eukaryotes. By binding to either DNA, RNA, or DNA:RNA hybrids, these proteins function in genome stabilization, chromatin organization, gene regulation, and/or translational modulation. In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, six Alba domain proteins PfAlba1-6 have been described, of which PfAlba1 has emerged as a \"master regulator\" of translation during parasite intra-erythrocytic development (IED). Given that a tight control of gene expression is especially important during IED, when malaria pathogenesis manifests, in this study, we focus on three other P. falciparum Albas, PfAlba2-4. Because genetic manipulation of the genomic loci of PfAlba2-4 was unsuccessful, we overexpressed each of these proteins from an episome under a strong constitutive promoter. We observed that PfAlba2 or PfAlba3 overexpression strongly reduced parasite growth and impacted IED stage transitions. In contrast, elevated levels of PfAlba4 were well-tolerated by the parasite. In keeping with this, differential gene expression analysis using RNA-seq of PfAlba2 or PfAlba3 overexpressing strains revealed a significant misregulation of mRNAs encoding virulence factors, such as those related to erythrocyte invasion; a general repression of var gene expression was also apparent. PfAlba4 overexpression, on the other hand, did not significantly perturb the steady-state transcriptome of IED stages and appeared to enhance var mRNA levels. Moreover, distinct sets of genes were targeted by each PfAlba for regulation. Taken together, this study highlights the nonredundant roles of PfAlba proteins in the P. falciparum IED, emphasizing their importance in subtelomeric chromatin biology and RNA regulation.IMPORTANCEThe malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum tightly controls the expression of its genes at the epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational levels to synthesize essential proteins, including virulence factors, in a timely and spatially coordinated manner. A family of six proteins implicated in this process is called PfAlba, characterized by the presence of the DNA-, RNA- or DNA:RNA hybrid-binding Alba domain. To better understand the cellular pathways regulated by this protein family, we overexpressed three PfAlbas during P. falciparum intra-erythrocytic growth and found that high levels of PfAlba2 and PfAlba3 were detrimental to parasite development. This was accompanied by significant changes in the parasite's transcriptome, either with regards to mRNA steady-state levels or expression timing. PfAlba4 overexpression, on the other hand, was well-tolerated by the parasite. Overall, our results delineate specific pathways targeted by individual PfAlbas for regulation and link PfAlba2/PfAlba3 to mutually exclusive expression of the virulence-promoting surface antigen PfEMP1."

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial retrograde signaling (MRS) pathways relay the functional status of mitochondria to elicit homeostatic or adaptive changes in nuclear gene expression. Budding yeast have \"intergenomic signaling\" pathways that sense the amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) independently of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the primary function of genes encoded by mtDNA. However, MRS pathways that sense the amount of mtDNA in mammalian cells remain poorly understood. We found that mtDNA-depleted IMR90 cells can sustain OXPHOS for a significant amount of time, providing a robust model system to interrogate human intergenomic signaling. We identified FAM43A, a largely uncharacterized protein, as a CHK2-dependent early responder to mtDNA depletion. Depletion of FAM43A activates a mitochondrial biogenesis program, resulting in an increase in mitochondrial mass and mtDNA copy number via CHK2-mediated upregulation of the p53R2 form of ribonucleotide reductase. We propose that FAM43A performs a checkpoint-like function to limit mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover under conditions of mtDNA depletion or replication stress."

    "abstract": "Background: Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and their exosomes (exos) are involved in shaping the immune microenvironment, which is important for tumor invasion and recurrence. However, studies involving GSC-derived exosomal circular RNAs (GDE-circRNAs) in regulating tumor microenvironment (TME) remain unknown. Here, we comprehensively evaluated the significance of a novel immune-related GDE-circRNA in glioma microenvironment.\nMethods: GDE-circPRKD3 was screened out through high-throughput sequencing and verified by RT-PCR, sanger sequencing and RNase R assays. A series of in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to investigate the function of GDE-circPRKD3. RNA-seq, RNA immunoprecipitation, multicolor flow cytometry and western blotting were used to explore the regulation of GDE-circPRKD3 on STAT3 signaling-mediated TME remodeling.\nResults: We have characterized a circRNA PRKD3 in GSC exosomes, and lower circPRKD3 expression predicts a worse prognosis for glioblastoma patients. Overexpression of GDE-circPRKD3 significantly impairs the biological competence of glioma and prolongs the survival of xenograft mice. GDE-circPRKD3 binds to HNRNPC in an m6A-dependent manner, accelerates mRNA decay of IL6ST and inhibits downstream target STAT3. Notably, GDE-circPRKD3 promotes CXCL10 secretion by reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages, which in turn recruits CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes against GBM. Moreover, brain-targeted lipid nanoparticle delivery of circPRKD3 combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy achieves significant combinatorial benefits.\nConclusion: This study provides a novel mechanism by which GDE-circPRKD3 relies on STAT3 signaling to remodel immunosuppressive TME and offers a potential RNA immunotherapy strategy for GBM treatment."

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment of cancer, though they come with the risk of immune-related adverse (irAEs) events such as hepatotoxicity or Immune-mediated Liver Injury from Checkpoint Inhibitors (ILICI). ILICI is a serious irAE that, when severe, requires cessation of ICI and initiation of immunosuppression. Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) play a central role in ILICI; however, they are just part of the picture as immunotherapy broadly impacts all aspects of the immune microenvironment and can directly and indirectly activate innate and adaptive immune cells. Clinically, as our understanding of this entity grows, we encounter new challenges. The presentation of ILICI is heterogeneous with respect to latency, pattern of injury (hepatitis vs. cholangitis) and severity. This review focuses on our knowledge regarding risk factors, presentation and treatment of ILICI including ILICI refractory to steroids. An emerging topic, the possibility of rechallenge while accepting some risk, in patients who experience ILICI but require immunotherapy, is also discussed. This review provides an update on the current knowns and unknowns in ILICI and highlights several knowledge gaps where studies are needed."

In light of recent studies, this meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effect of SGLT2i on the prognosis of patients with ATTR-CM.\nMethods: A comprehensive search of Medline, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was conducted up to November 17, 2024. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were carried out independently by two investigators. Associations of SGLT2i with outcomes were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses.\nResults: A total of five studies (9766 participants, 4 propensity score-matched) were included. The use of SGLT2i was associated with significant reductions in all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) .54, 95% confidence interval (CI) .44-.66], cardiovascular mortality (HR .39, 95% CI .23-.65), major adverse cardiovascular events (HR .71, 95% CI .61-.83), and heart failure hospitalizations (HFHs) (HR .63, 95% CI .52-.77) compared to non-use. The odds of cardiac arrhythmias were significantly lower among SGLT2i users compared to non-users [odds ratio (OR) .73, 95% CI .65-.83]. Specifically, SGLT2i use was associated with significant reductions in the odds of atrial fibrillation (AF) (OR .75, 95% CI .62-.91), ventricular tachycardia (OR .72, 95% CI .59-.88), and sudden cardiac arrest (OR .71, 95% CI .50-.99).\nConclusions: The use of SGLT2is may be associated with a more favourable prognosis in patients with ATTR-CM. Adequately powered, long-term RCTs are required to validate the available observational evidence."

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in obese patients remains challenging. Recent studies have linked obesity to an increased risk of TNBC and malignancies. Through multiomic analysis and experimental validation, a dysfunctional Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit H (EIF3H)/Yes-associated protein (YAP) proteolytic axis is identified as a pivotal junction mediating the interplay between cancer-associated adipocytes and the response to anti-cancer drugs in TNBC. Mechanistically, cancer-associated adipocytes drive metabolic reprogramming resulting in an upregulated hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). This aberrant upregulation of HBP promotes YAP O-GlcNAcylation and the subsequent recruitment of EIF3H deubiquitinase, which stabilizes YAP, thus promoting tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance. It is found that Retatrutide, an anti-obesity agent, inhibits HBP and YAP O-GlcNAcylation leading to increased YAP degradation through the deprivation of EIF3H-mediated deubiquitylation of YAP. In preclinical models of obese TNBC, Retatrutide downregulates HBP, decreases YAP protein levels, and consequently decreases tumor size and enhances chemotherapy efficacy. This effect is particularly pronounced in obese mice bearing TNBC tumors. Overall, these findings reveal a critical interplay between adipocyte-mediated metabolic reprogramming and EIF3H-mediated YAP proteolytic control, offering promising therapeutic strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of obesity on TNBC progression."

Experts gathered to explore the role of T cells in neurodegenerative diseases. Key topics included characterization of antigen-specific immune responses, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, microbial etiology in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and microglia-T cell crosstalk, with a focus on how T cells affect neuroinflammation and AD biomarkers like amyloid beta and tau. The symposium also examined immunotherapies for AD, including the Valacyclovir Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (VALAD) trial, and two clinical trials leveraging regulatory T cell approaches for multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy. Additionally, single-cell RNA/TCR sequencing of T cells and other immune cells provided insights into immune dynamics in neurodegenerative diseases. This article highlights key findings from the symposium and outlines future research directions to further understand the role of T cells in neurodegeneration, offering innovative therapeutic approaches for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. HIGHLIGHTS: Researchers gathered to discuss approaches to study T cells in brain disorders. New technologies allow high-throughput screening of antigen-specific T cells. Microbial infections can precede several serious and chronic neurological diseases. Central and peripheral T cell responses shape neurological disease pathology. Immunotherapy can induce regulatory T cell responses in neuroinflammatory disorders."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction. The strong link between nutrition and the occurrence and progression of AD pathology has been well documented. Poor nutritional status accelerates AD progress by potentially aggravating amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau deposition, exacerbating oxidative stress response, modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and disrupting blood-brain barrier function. The advanced stage of AD tends to lead to malnutrition due to cognitive impairments, sensory dysfunctions, brain atrophy, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). This, in turn, produces a vicious cycle between malnutrition and AD. This review discusses how nutritional factors and AD deteriorate each other from the early stage of AD to the terminal stages of AD, focusing on the potential of different levels of nutritional factors, ranging from micronutrients to diet patterns. This review provides novel insights into reducing the risk of AD, delaying its progression, and improving prognosis. HIGHLIGHTS: Two-fifths of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases worldwide have been attributed to potentially modifiable risk factors. Up to ≈26% of community-dwelling patients with AD are malnourished, compared to 7%∼76% of institutionalized patients. Undernutrition effects the onset, progression, and prognosis of AD through multiple mechanisms. Various levels of nutritional supports were confirmed to be protective factors for AD via specific mechanisms."

These inflammatory skin diseases affect a wide range of age groups, including pregnant women and children; however, little is known about their biological effects on pre- and postnatal development. Therefore, we report and discuss the results of an enhanced pre- and postnatal development study in cynomolgus monkeys treated with nemolizumab, which also incorporates an assessment of juvenile toxicities.\nMethods: Nemolizumab was subcutaneously administered at doses of 1 or 25 mg/kg to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys once every 2 weeks (biweekly) from Gestation Day 20 until delivery, to investigate the potential toxicities on pre- and postnatal development. Additionally, their offspring were subcutaneously dosed biweekly with 1 or 25 mg/kg from approximately 1 to 7 months after birth to investigate the potential toxicities on juveniles, considering the age of the target patient population. The examination included tests for immune function and nervous system involvement by IL-31, as well as the standard assessments outlined in the ICH S5 guideline to comprehensively assess the safety profile.\nResults: No nemolizumab-related toxicities were observed in both dams and offspring up to 25 mg/kg. Maternal plasma nemolizumab concentrations were well maintained during the gestation period, gradually decreasing after delivery. Plasma concentrations in the offspring, higher than in dams, was maintained until scheduled necropsy.\nConclusion: Blocking IL-31 signaling with repeated dosing of nemolizumab did not adversely affect pregnancy, parturition, nursing, or postnatal physical and functional development in cynomolgus monkeys."

    "abstract": "TBC1D20 deficiency causes Warburg Micro Syndrome in humans, characterized by multiple eye abnormalities, severe intellectual disability, and abnormal sexual development, but the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we identify TBC1D20 as a novel Rab11 GTPase-activating protein that coordinates vesicle transport and actin remodeling to regulate ciliogenesis. Depletion of TBC1D20 promotes Rab11 vesicle accumulation and actin deconstruction around the centrosome, facilitating the initiation of ciliogenesis even in cycling cells. Further investigations reveal enhanced Rab11-MICAL1 interaction upon TBC1D20 loss, activating the monooxygenase domain of MICAL1 and inducing F-actin depolymerization around the centrosome. This actin network reorganization facilitates vesicle trafficking and docking, ultimately promoting ciliogenesis. In summary, our work uncovers a coordinated ciliogenesis initiation mechanism via Rab11 activation. These findings underscore a pivotal role for TBC1D20 in early ciliogenesis, advancing our understanding of its spatiotemporal regulation and offering insights into the disease pathogenesis associated with TBC1D20 mutations."

    "abstract": "Introduction: The beneficial effects of amyloid beta 1-38, or Aβ(1-38), on Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in humans in vivo remain controversial. We investigated AD patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ(1-38) and AD progression.\nMethods: Cognitive function and diagnostic change were assessed annually for 3 years in 177 Aβ-positive participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) longitudinal cognitive impairment and dementia study (DELCODE) cohort using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria. Mixed linear and Cox regression analyses were conducted. CSF was collected at baseline.\nResults: Higher Aβ(1-38) levels were associated with slower PACC (p = 0.001) and slower CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) (p = 0.002) but not MMSE decline. Including Aβ(1-40) beyond Aβ(1-38) in the model confirmed an association of Aβ(1-38) with slower PACC decline (p = 0.005), but not with CDR-SB or MMSE decline. In addition, higher Aβ(1-38) baseline levels were associated with a reduced dementia conversion risk.\nDiscussion: Further research is needed to understand the role of Aβ(1-38) in AD and its potential for future therapeutic strategies.\nHighlights: This study not only replicates but also extends the existing findings on the role of Aβ(1-38) (amyloid beta 1-38) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans in vivo. Higher baseline Aβ(1-38) levels were associated with a decreased risk of conversion to AD dementia in subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Different linear-mixed regression models suggest an association between higher Aβ(1-38) baseline levels and slower Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) decline. Including Aβ(1-40) beyond Aβ(1-38) in the model confirmed a link between Aβ(1-38) and PACC decline, but showed no association of Aβ(1-38) on CDR-SB and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) decline. The impact of short Aβ isoforms in AD progression might have been under-investigated These findings underscore the urgent need for additional research on the role of these shorter Aβ peptides in AD, as they may hold key insights for future therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Background: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the management of lateral epicondylitis (LE) have been characterized by substantial variability in reported outcomes. The source of this heterogeneity is uncertain.\nPurpose: To determine the effect of estimated platelet concentration on the efficacy of PRP for the management of LE.\nStudy design: Systematic review and meta-analysis; Level of evidence, 2.\nMethods: All RCTs evaluating the efficacy of PRP in managing LE were identified. RCTs were classified according to whether the study documented a platelet concentration factor of PRP representing a greater than 3-fold increase over whole blood or a supraphysiological platelet dose (high-dose vs low-dose PRP). The primary outcome was the mean difference (MD) in the visual analog scale (VAS) score at latest follow-up. Random-effects and mixed-effects meta-analyses were performed, and meta-regression was used to evaluate whether differences in outcomes after treatment with PRP could be explained by differences in the concentration of PRP used.\nResults: Overall, 13 RCTs with a total of 791 patients were included in this analysis, with 5 that utilized low-dose PRP and 8 that used high-dose PRP. Meta-analysis of VAS scores reported by studies that used high-dose PRP resulted in an MD of -1.31 (95% CI, -1.87 to -0.75) in favor of PRP over all alternative treatment strategies (P < .001). Meta-analysis of VAS scores reported by studies that used low-dose PRP resulted in an MD of 0.08 (95% CI, -0.51 to 0.68), suggesting no difference in the effect between PRP and all alternative treatment strategies (P = .79). The platelet concentration factor of PRP used in each RCT was found to be strongly predictive of the VAS score at final follow-up in meta-regression (P < .001), with 58.5% of the heterogeneity in the outcomes of PRP between studies explained by the platelet concentration factor alone.\nConclusion: The platelet concentration of PRP may play a significant role in the outcomes of patients with LE. A direct linear relationship was observed between the platelet concentration factor of PRP used and the magnitude of patient-reported symptom relief after the management of LE with PRP. Clinicians should ensure a supraphysiological platelet concentration when preparing PRP for the management of LE."

Reduced muscle mass and visceral fat accumulation are important features of a body composition phenotype in which obesity and muscle loss coexist, but their relationship with COVID-19 outcomes remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between the erector spinae muscle (ESM) to epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) ratio (ESM/EAT) on chest CT and disease severity in patients with COVID-19.\nMethods: We analysed data from 1074 COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Japan COVID-19 Task Force database. The primary outcome was the rate of critical outcomes (requiring high-flow oxygen therapy, invasive ventilator support or death). The incidence of critical outcomes was compared between patients with high and low ESM/EAT ratios.\nResults: The low ESM/EAT group (n = 353) had a higher incidence of critical outcomes (13.3% vs. 5.13%, p < 0.001) and mortality (2.55% vs. 0.69%, p = 0.019) than the high ESM/EAT group (n = 721). In multivariable analysis, the low ESM/EAT ratio was associated with critical outcomes (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-3.66) independently of the known COVID-19 severity factors including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, lifestyle-related comorbidities and pneumonia volume.\nConclusion: The low ESM/EAT ratio in COVID-19 patients can be obtained on chest CT and used to predict critical outcomes after disease onset, demonstrating the importance of detailed body composition assessments in COVID-19 practice."

    "heading": "Predictive factors for treatment responses to baricitinib in severe alopecia areata: A retrospective, multivariate analysis of 70 cases from a single center",
    "abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by non-scarring hair loss. Baricitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi), prevents hair loss and promotes hair regrowth by inhibiting the inflammatory Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway involved in cytotoxic T cell responses targeting hair follicles. The introduction of JAKi has transformed treatment against severe AA. However, treatment responses to JAKi are highly variable among patients, and the predictors of responsiveness remain insufficiently elucidated. This study aimed to identify independent predictive factors for the efficacy of baricitinib in patients with severe AA using multivariate analyses. A retrospective study was conducted on 70 severe AA patients who started baricitinib treatment at Tohoku University Hospital between July 2022 and August 2023. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients achieving a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score of ≤20 after 9 months of baricitinib treatment. Multivariate analysis assessed potential predictors of baricitinib treatment responses, including AA type, sex, age, disease duration, history of atopic dermatitis, intravenous methylprednisolone pulse (IVMP) therapy, and Clinician-Reported Outcome (ClinRO) measures for eyebrows and eyelashes. Achievement of a SALT score of ≤20 and SALT score improvement rates were used as objective variables in the multivariate analyses. Among the 70 patients completing 9 months of baricitinib treatment, 41% achieved a SALT score of ≤20. Multivariate analyses identified several independent predictors for positive outcomes, including shorter disease duration (≤4 years), history of IVMP, therapy SALT score of ≤95 at baricitinib initiation, and female sex. Further, we found differential response patterns based on AA type and sex. Specifically, AA type significantly influenced treatment responses, with ophiasis alopecia (OA) associated with the poorest improvement rate. In summary, the response to baricitinib in AA is significantly influenced by sex, AA type, disease duration, history of IVMP, and pre-treatment SALT score."

    "heading": "Distinct single cell transcriptional profile in CD4+ T-lymphocytes among obese children with asthma",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Obesity is a risk factor for asthma morbidity, associated with less responsiveness to inhaled corticosteroids. CD4+ T-cells are central to the immunology of asthma and may contribute to the unique obese asthma phenotype. We sought to characterize the single cell CD4+ Transcriptional profile differences in obese children with asthma compared to normal weight children with asthma. Methods: Eight normal weight and obese participants with asthma were clinically phenotyped and matched based on asthma control. Peripheral blood (PB) CD4+ T-cells were sorted, and single cell RNA sequencing was conducted. Cell clusters were identified by canonical gene expression, differential gene expression and reactome pathway analysis was applied. The obese PB bulk transcriptomic signature from the U-BIOPRED pediatric cohort was assessed in our cohort as well. Results: Obese children with asthma have a distinct CD4+ transcriptional profile with differential gene expression. There were more activated protein tyrosine phosphate receptor type C (PTPRC)high cells and less PTPRClow in the obese children. Obese children had higher enrichment of the neutrophil degranulation, interleukin-7 (IL-7) receptor and IL-7-related janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathways. Genes previously associated with more severe asthma, IL-32, FKBP5 gene expression, IL-6 and Rho transcriptional signaling, were also enriched in obese children with asthma. Discussion: Our findings shed insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning more severe and steroid-resistant asthma among obese children. Further investigation is needed to identify potential new therapeutic targets for this group."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Sleep disturbances are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), but the relationship between sleep architecture, particularly rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and AD/ADRD biomarkers remains unclear.\nMethods: We enrolled 128 adults (64 with Alzheimer's disease, 41 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 23 with normal cognition [NC]), mean age 70.8 ± 9.6 years, 56.9% female, from a tertiary hospital in China. Participants underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG), amyloid β (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET), and plasma biomarker analysis: phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).\nResults: After adjusting for demographics, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status, cognition, and comorbidities, the highest tertile of REM latency was associated with higher Aβ burden (β = 0.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03 to 0.13, p = 0.002), elevated p-tau181 (β = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.13, p = 0.002), and reduced BDNF levels (β = -0.47, 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.13, p = 0.013), compared to the lowest tertile.\nDiscussion: Prolonged REM latency may serve as a novel marker or risk factor for AD/ADRD pathogenesis.\nHighlights: Rapid eye movement latency (REML) may be a potential marker for Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) pathogenesis. Prolonged REML was associated with higher amyloid beta (Aβ) burden, phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181), and lower brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Intervention trial is needed to determine if targeting REML can modify AD/ADRD risk. Slow-wave sleep was not associated with AD/ADRD biomarkers."

    "abstract": "Background: People undergoing major orthopaedic surgery are at increased risk of postoperative thromboembolic events. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are recommended for thromboprophylaxis in this population. New oral anticoagulants, including direct factor Xa inhibitors, are recommended as alternatives. They may have more advantages than disadvantages compared to LMWHs and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs, another type of anticoagulant).\nObjectives: To assess the benefits and harms of prophylactic anticoagulation with direct factor Xa inhibitors compared with low molecular weight heparins and vitamin K antagonists in people undergoing major orthopaedic surgery for elective total hip or knee replacement or hip fracture surgery.\nSearch methods: We searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trial registers to 11 November 2023. We conducted reference checks to identify additional studies.\nSelection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of direct factor Xa inhibitors to LMWHs or VKAs in people undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.\nData collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, major venous thromboembolism (VTE), symptomatic VTE, major bleeding, and serious hepatic and non-hepatic adverse events. We evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies using Cochrane's risk of bias 1 tool. We calculated estimates of treatment effects using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence.\nMain results: We included 53 RCTs (44,371 participants). Participants' average age was 64 years (range: 18 to 93 years). Only one RCT compared a VKA with direct factor Xa inhibitors. All 53 RCTs compared direct factor Xa inhibitors with LMWHs. Twenty-three studies included participants undergoing total hip replacement; 21 studies, total knee replacement; and three studies included people having hip fracture surgery. The studies' average duration was approximately 42 days (range: two to 720 days). Compared to LMWHs, direct factor Xa inhibitors may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.31; I2 = 0%; 28 studies, 29,698 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Direct factor Xa inhibitors may make little to no difference to major venous thromboembolic events compared to LMWHs, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71; absolute risk difference: 12 fewer major VTE events per 1000 participants, 95% CI 16 fewer to 7 fewer; I2 = 48%; 28 studies, 24,574 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Compared to LMWHs, direct factor Xa inhibitors may reduce symptomatic VTE (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.83; I2 = 0%; 33 studies, 31,670 participants; low-certainty evidence). The absolute benefit of substituting factor Xa inhibitors for LMWHs may be between two and five fewer symptomatic VTE episodes per 1000 patients. In the meta-analysis with all studies pooled, direct factor Xa inhibitors appeared to make little or no difference to major bleeding compared to LMWHs, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30; I2 = 15%; 36 studies, 39,778 participants; very low certainty-evidence). • In a subgroup analysis limited to studies comparing rivaroxaban to LMWHs, people given rivaroxaban may have had more major bleeding events (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.98; I2 = 0%; 17 studies, 17,630 participants; low-certainty evidence). The absolute risk of substituting rivaroxaban for LMWH may be between one and seven more major bleeding events per 1000 patients. • In a subgroup analysis limited to studies comparing direct factor Xa inhibitors other than rivaroxaban to LMWHs, people given these other direct factor Xa inhibitors may have had fewer major bleeding events, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.02; absolute risk difference: 3 fewer major bleeding events per 1000 participants, 95% CI 5 fewer to 0 fewer; I2 = 0%; 19 studies, 22,148 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Direct factor Xa inhibitors may make little to no difference in serious hepatic adverse events compared to LMWHs, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 3.01, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.93; 2 studies, 3169 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Only two studies reported this outcome, with one death in the intervention group due to hepatitis reported in one study, and no events reported in the other study. People given direct factor Xa inhibitors may have a lower risk of serious non-hepatic adverse events than those given LMWHs (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97; I2 = 18%; 15 studies, 26,246 participants; low-certainty evidence). The absolute benefit of substituting factor Xa inhibitors for LMWH may be between three and 14 fewer serious non-hepatic adverse events per 1000 patients. Only one study compared a direct factor Xa inhibitor with a VKA. It reported outcome data with imprecise results due to the small number of events. It showed no difference in the effects of the study drugs.\nAuthors' conclusions: Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may slightly reduce symptomatic VTE events when compared with LMWH. They may make little or no difference to major VTE events, but the evidence is very uncertain. In the evaluation of major bleeding, the evidence suggests rivaroxaban results in a slight increase in major bleeding events compared to LMWHs. The remaining oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may have little to no effect on major bleeding, but the evidence is very uncertain. Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may reduce serious non-hepatic adverse events slightly compared to LMWHs. They may have little to no effect on serious hepatic adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain. Due to the high rates of missing participants and selective outcome reporting, the effect estimates may be biased."

    "heading": "Intestinal Bacteroides drives glioma progression by regulating CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration",
    "abstract": "Background: The intestinal microbiota regulates normal brain physiology and the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders. While prior studies suggested that this regulation operates through immune cells, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Leveraging two well characterized murine models of low-grade glioma (LGG) occurring in the setting of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome, we sought to determine the impact of the gut microbiome on optic glioma progression.\nMethods: Nf1-mutant mice genetically engineered to develop optic pathway gliomas (Nf1OPG mice) by 3 months of age were reared under germ-free (GF) conditions, treated with specific cocktails of antibiotics, or given fecal matter transplants (FMTs). Intestinal microbial species were identified by 16S genotyping. Neutralizing TGFβ antibodies were delivered systemically, while in vitro experiments used isolated murine microglia and T cells. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis was performed using established methods.\nResults: Nf1 OPG mice raised in a GF environment or postnatally treated with vancomycin did not harbor optic gliomas or exhibit OPG-induced retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, which was reversed following conventionally raised mouse FMT or colonization with Bacteroides species. Moreover, this intestinal microbiota-regulated gliomagenesis was mediated by circulating TGFβ, such that systemic TGFβ neutralization reduced Nf1-OPG growth. TGFβ was shown to act on tumor-associated monocytes to induce Ccl3 expression and recruit CD8+ T cells necessary for glioma growth.\nConclusions: Taken together, these findings establish, for the first time, a mechanistic relationship between Bacteroides in the intestinal microbiome and NF1-LGG pathobiology, suggesting both future predictive risk assessment strategies and therapeutic opportunities."

    "heading": "Alendronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women",
    "abstract": "Rationale: Osteoporosis is an abnormal reduction in bone mass and bone deterioration, leading to increased fracture risk. Alendronate belongs to the bisphosphonate class of drugs, which inhibit bone resorption by interfering with the activity of osteoclasts (bone cells that break down bone tissue). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008.\nObjectives: To assess the benefits and harms of alendronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women at lower and higher risk of fracture, respectively.\nSearch methods: We searched Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (which includes CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, two trial registers, drug approval agency websites, and the bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews to identify the studies included in this review. The latest search date was 01 February 2023. We imposed no restrictions on language, date, form of publication, or reported outcomes.\nEligibility criteria: We included only randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of alendronate on postmenopausal women. Targeted participants must have received at least one year of alendronate. We classified a study as secondary prevention if its population met one or more of the following hierarchical criteria: a diagnosis of osteoporosis, a history of vertebral fractures, a low bone mineral density T-score (-2.5 or lower), and 75 years old or older. If a study population met none of those criteria, we classified it as a primary prevention study.\nOutcomes: Our major outcomes were clinical vertebral, non-vertebral, hip, and wrist fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events.\nRisk of bias: We used the Cochrane risk of bias 1 tool.\nSynthesis methods: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Based on the previous review experience, in which the clinical and methodological characteristics in the primary and secondary prevention studies were homogeneous, we used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis and estimated effects using the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. Our base case analyses included all eligible placebo-controlled studies with usable data. We selected the data available for the longest treatment period. We consider a relative change exceeding 15% as clinically important.\nIncluded studies: We included 119 studies, of which 102 studies provided data for quantitative synthesis. Of these, we classified 34 studies (15,188 participants) as primary prevention and 68 studies (29,577 participants) as secondary prevention. We had concerns about risks of bias in most studies. Selection bias was the most frequently overlooked domain, with only 20 studies (19%) describing appropriate methods for both sequence generation and allocation concealment. Eight studies (8%) were at low risk of bias in all seven domains.\nSynthesis of results: The base case analyses included 16 primary prevention studies (one to five years in length; 10,057 women) and 20 secondary prevention studies (one to three years in length; 7375 women) which compared alendronate 10 mg/day (or 70 mg/week) to placebo, no treatment, or both. Indirectness, imprecision, and risk of bias emerged as the main factors contributing to the downgrading of the certainty of the evidence. For primary prevention, alendronate may lead to a clinically important reduction in clinical vertebral fractures (16/1190 in the alendronate group versus 24/926 in the placebo group; RR 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25 to 0.84; absolute risk reduction [ARR] 1.4% fewer, 95% CI 1.9% fewer to 0.4% fewer; low-certainty evidence) and non-vertebral fractures (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97; ARR 1.6% fewer, 95% CI 2.6% fewer to 0.3% fewer; low-certainty evidence). However, clinically important differences were not observed for the following outcomes: hip fractures (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.32; ARR 0.2% fewer, 95% CI 0.4% fewer to 0.2% more; low-certainty evidence); wrist fractures (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.49; ARR 0.3% more, 95% CI 0.4% fewer to 1.1% more; low-certainty evidence); withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.18; ARR 0.2% more, 95% CI 0.9% fewer to 1.5% more; low-certainty evidence); and serious adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.43; ARR 0.5% more, 95% CI 1.2% fewer to 2.8% more; low-certainty evidence). For secondary prevention, alendronate probably results in a clinically important reduction in clinical vertebral fractures (24/1114 in the alendronate group versus 51/1055 in the placebo group; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.73; ARR 2.7% fewer, 95% CI 3.5% fewer to 1.3% fewer; moderate-certainty evidence). It may lead to a clinically important reduction in non-vertebral fractures (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99; ARR 2.8% fewer, 95% CI 5.1% fewer to 0.1% fewer; low-certainty evidence); hip fractures (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.96; ARR 1.0% fewer, 95% CI 1.5% fewer to 0.1% fewer; low-certainty evidence); wrist fractures (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.90; ARR 1.8% fewer, 95% CI 2.6% fewer to 0.4% fewer; low-certainty evidence); and serious adverse events (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96; ARR 3.5% fewer, 95% CI 5.8% fewer to 0.6% fewer; low-certainty evidence). However, the effects of alendronate for withdrawals due to adverse events are uncertain (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.16; ARR 0.4% fewer, 95% CI 1.7% fewer to 1.3% more; very low-certainty evidence). Furthermore, the updated evidence for the safety risks of alendronate suggests that, irrespective of participants' risk of fracture, alendronate may lead to little or no difference for gastrointestinal adverse events. Zero incidents of osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fracture were observed.\nAuthors' conclusions: For primary prevention, compared to placebo, alendronate 10 mg/day may reduce clinical vertebral and non-vertebral fractures, but it might make little or no difference to hip and wrist fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events. For secondary prevention, alendronate probably reduces clinical vertebral fractures, and may reduce non-vertebral, hip, and wrist fractures, and serious adverse events, compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of alendronate on withdrawals due to adverse events.\nFunding: This Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.\nRegistration: This review is an update of the previous review (DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001155)."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) induce p53-dependent apoptosis in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). To interrogate this phenomenon, a synthetic ITR (SynITR), harboring substitutions in putative p53 binding sites was generated and evaluated for vector production and gene delivery. Replication of SynITR flanked transgenic genome was similar compared to wild type (wt) ITR, with a modest increase in vector titers. Packaged in the AAV2 capsid, wtITR and SynITR vectors demonstrated similar transduction efficiencies of human cells without toxicity. Following AAV2-wtITR vector infection of hESCs, rapid apoptosis was observed as reported. In contrast, infection by AAV2 vectors packaged with SynITRs attenuated the wtITR-induced hESC toxicity. While hESC particle entry and the abundance of double stranded circular episomes was similar for the ITR contexts, reporter expression was inhibited from transduced SynITR genomes. Mechanistically, infection of hESCs induced γH2AX in an ITR-independent manner, however, canonical activation of p53α was uncoupled using AAV-SynITR. Further investigations in hESCs revealed additional novel findings: (i) p53β is uniquely and constitutively active and (ii) AAV vector infection, independent of the ITR sequence, induces activation of p53ψ. The data herein reveal an ITR-dependent AAV vector transduction restriction specific to hESCs and manipulation of the DNA damage response via ITR engineering."

    "abstract": "Background: RING finger protein 213 (RNF213) p.R4810K is an established risk factor for moyamoya disease and intracranial artery stenosis in East Asian people. Recent evidence suggests its potential association with extracranial cardiovascular diseases, including pulmonary hypertension. We hypothesized that insidious abnormal cardiac functions are detected in RNF213 p.R4810K carriers with cerebrovascular diseases.\nMethods and results: We investigated patients registered in the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center Genome Registry between May 2017 and August 2021 who underwent echocardiography. All patients had cerebrovascular diseases. Patients with a medical history of chronic heart or pulmonary diseases were excluded. RNF213 p.R4810K was genotyped in all the patients. Of 2089 patients registered in the registry, 71 carriers and 1241 noncarriers were eligible for our analyses. The carriage of RNF213 p.R4810K emerged as a significant predictor for longer right ventricular outflow tract acceleration time in multivariable linear regression analysis (β=8.33 [95% CI, 0.92-15.74]; P=0.028). Additionally, the carriers showed increased odds of having right ventricular outflow tract acceleration time values ≥150 milliseconds (odds ratio, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.18-4.18]; P=0.014) in multivariable logistic regression analysis.\nConclusions: A longer right ventricular outflow tract acceleration time may reflect an increased pulmonary vascular bed induced by abnormal vascular collateral networks and dilation of capillary vessels in peripheral pulmonary arteries in the preclinical stage of RNF213-related pulmonary hypertension. Thus, the right ventricular outflow tract acceleration time marker in RNF213 p.R4810K carriers suggests a biphasic course from the presymptomatic to symptomatic phase. Furthermore, vascular neurologists should carefully examine multiple organs because RNF213-related vasculopathy covers systemic cardiovascular diseases.\nRegistration: URL: https://www.umin.ac.jp; Unique identifier: UMIN000050750."

    "abstract": "Background: Complement activation may promote atherosclerosis. Yet, data on the to which extent complement, and more specifically the alternative complement pathway, is activated in patients with carotid atherosclerosis and related to adverse outcome in these patients, are scarce.\nMethods and results: We measured, by ELISA, plasma levels of factor D, properdin, C3bBbP (C3 convertase), and factor H in patients with advanced carotid atherosclerosis in a Discovery (n=324) and in a Validation (n=206) cohort in relation to adverse outcome (mean follow-up 7.8 and 6.6 years, respectively). Our major findings were as follows. Compared with healthy controls, patients with carotid atherosclerosis had increased plasma levels of factor D, properdin, and C3bBbP (P<0.001), but not factor H, an inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway, compared with controls. Although patients with carotid atherosclerosis had elevated levels of properdin compared with controls, within these patients, low plasma levels of properdin (ie, <median levels of properdin in the patient group) were significantly associated with cardiovascular mortality. This was seen in both the Discovery (HR 2.31, P=0.019) and the Validation cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 2.81, P=0.014). In contrast to the low circulating levels, high intraplaque properdin levels (assessed by ELISA) correlated with markers of plaque vulnerability and symptomatology.\nConclusions: We show a strong and independent association of low plasma properdin levels with cardiovascular mortality in 2 cohorts. Conversely, the plaque properdin levels linked to features of plaque vulnerability, potentially reflecting increased deposition at the site of inflammation or local production of properdin in the atherosclerotic lesion indicating local enhanced alternative complement pathway activation."

    "abstract": "Synthetic lethality approaches in BRCA1/2-mutated cancers have focused on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, which are subject to high rates of innate or acquired resistance in patients. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-based screening to identify DNA Ligase I (LIG1) as a novel target for synthetic lethality in BRCA1-mutated cancers. Publicly available data supported LIG1 hyperdependence of BRCA1-mutant cells across a variety of breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. We used CRISPRn, CRISPRi, RNAi, and protein degradation to confirm the lethal effect of LIG1 inactivation at the DNA, RNA, and protein level in BRCA1-mutant cells in vitro. LIG1 inactivation resulted in viability loss across multiple BRCA1-mutated cell lines, whereas no effect was observed in BRCA1/2 wild-type cell lines, demonstrating target selectivity for the BRCA1-mutant context. On-target nature of the phenotype was demonstrated through rescue of viability with exogenous wild-type LIG1 cDNA. Next, we demonstrated a concentration-dependent relationship of LIG1 protein expression and BRCA1 mutant cell viability using a titratable, degradable LIG1 fusion protein. BRCA1 mutant viability required LIG1 catalytic activity, as catalytically dead mutant LIG1K568A failed to rescue viability loss caused by endogenous LIG1 depletion. LIG1 perturbation produced proportional increases in PAR staining in BRCA1 mutant cells, indicating a mechanism consistent with the function of LIG1 in sealing ssDNA nicks. Finally, we confirmed LIG1 hyperdependence in vivo using a xenograft model in which LIG1 loss resulted in tumor stasis in all mice. Our cumulative findings demonstrate that LIG1 is a promising synthetic lethal target for development in patients with BRCA1 mutant cancers."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Diet diversity (DD) in infancy may be protective for early food allergy (FA) but there is limited knowledge about how DD incorporating consumption frequency influences FA risk.\nMethods: Three measures of DD were investigated in 2060 infants at 6 and/or at 9 months of age within the NorthPop Birth Cohort Study: a weighted DD score based on intake frequency, the number of introduced foods, and the number of introduced allergenic foods. In multivariable logistic regression models based on directed acyclic graphs, associations to parentally reported physician-diagnosed FA at age 9 and 18 months were estimated, including sensitivity and stratified analyses.\nResults: High weighted DD scores (24-31p) at age 9 months were associated with 61% decreased odds of FA at age 18 months [OR (95% CI) = 0.39 0.18-0.88] compared with infants with the lowest DD scores (0-17p). The association remained significant after exclusion of early FA cases. Having introduced 13-14 foods at age 9 months, independent of consumption frequency, was associated with 45% decreased odds of FA [OR (95% CI) = 0.55 (0.31-0.98)] compared to having introduced 0-10 foods. When stratifying, significantly reduced odds for FA were seen for children with eczema and for children with no FA history in the family. No association was seen between DD at age 6 months and FA at age 18 months.\nConclusion: A diverse diet at age 9 months may prevent FA at age 18 months. Our results underscore the need for additional investigations on the impact of consumption frequency in infancy."

    "heading": "The Prognostic Factors in Children With Status Epilepticus and Status Epilepticus Severity Score Scales",
    "abstract": "Background: According to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 2015 classification, status epilepticus (SE) is a seizure that lasts longer than 5 min or a frequency of more than one seizure within 5 min, without returning to a normal level of consciousness between episodes. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic factors of SE and compare our patients with those of patients treated internationally with the modified status epilepticus severity score (mSTESS) to determine the reliability of this scoring system. Methods: The medical records of patients aged 1 month-17 years with SE who were treated at Çukurova University-Balcalı Training and Research Hospital between September 2018 and September 2021 and who were followed in the intensive care unit were included in the study. Results: Seventy-two patients were included in this study. The mean age of the patients with SE was 5 years (3-8). The male/female ratio was 34 (47%)/38 (53%). A history of epilepsy was present in 53% of the patients. The most common etiologies behind SE were meningoencephalitis (19%), febrile status (8%), unknown status (12%), and genetic causes (7%). Comorbidities, including developmental delay/intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, hyperactivity, and autism spectrum disorder, were present in 44 (61%) of the patients. The cutoff was ≥ 2 for unfavorable outcomes and 4 for mortality in our patients according to the mSTESS system. The case mortality rate was 1% in our study. Nonconvulsive SE, slowing and abnormal ground on EEG, being stuporous or comatose, having abnormal MRI-CT, and having a comorbid condition were associated with an unfavorable prognosis in SE patients. Conclusion: The mSTESS is a useful and practical scoring system for predicting the prognosis of SE patients. Nonconvulsive SE, slowing and abnormal ground in EEG, being stuporous or comatose, abnormal MRI-CT, and the presence of comorbid conditions indicated poor prognosis of SE in children."

    "abstract": "The use of incretin analogues has emerged in recent years as an effective approach to achieve both enhanced insulin secretion and weight loss in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Agonists which bind and stimulate multiple receptors have shown particular promise. However, off target effects, including nausea and diarrhoea, remain a complication of using these agents, and modified versions with optimized pharmacological profiles and/or biased signaling at the cognate receptors are increasingly sought. Here, we describe the synthesis and properties of a molecule which binds to both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors (GLP-1R and GIPR) to enhance insulin secretion. HISHS-2001 shows increased affinity at the GLP-1R, as well as a tendency towards reduced internalization and recycling at this receptor versus FDA-approved dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonist tirzepatide. HISHS-2001 also displayed significantly greater bias towards cAMP generation versus β-arrestin 2 recruitment compared to tirzepatide. In contrast, Gαs recruitment was lower versus tirzepatide at the GLP-1R, but higher at the GIPR. Administered to obese hyperglycaemic db/db mice, HISHS-2001 increased circulating insulin whilst lowering body weight and HbA1c with similar efficacy to tirzepatide at substantially lower doses. Thus, HISHS-2001 represents a novel dual receptor agonist with an improved pharmacological profile."

    "abstract": "Pf bacteriophages, lysogenic viruses that infect Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic Pa infections; phage-infected (Pf+) strains are known to predominate in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) who are older and have more severe disease. However, the transmission patterns of Pf underlying the progressive dominance of Pf+ strains are unclear. In particular, it is unknown whether phage transmission commonly occurs horizontally between bacteria within the airway via viral particles or if Pf+ bacteria are mostly acquired via new Pseudomonas infections. Here, we have studied Pa genomic sequences from 3 patient cohorts totaling 663 clinical isolates from 105 pwCF. We identify Pf+ isolates and analyze transmission patterns of Pf within patients between genetically similar groups of bacteria called \"clone types\". We find that Pf is predominantly passed down vertically within Pa lineages and rarely via horizontal transfer between clone types within the airway. Conversely, we find extensive evidence of Pa superinfection by a new, genetically distinct Pa that is Pf+. Finally, we find that clinical isolates show reduced activity of the type IV pilus and reduced susceptibility to Pf in vitro. These results cast new light on the transmission of virulence-associated phages in the clinical setting."

    "abstract": "Background: Deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCase), caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene, is the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the consequence of reduced enzyme activity within neural cell sub-types remains ambiguous. Thus, the purpose of this study was to define the effect of GCase deficiency specifically in human astrocytes and test their non-cell autonomous influence upon dopaminergic neurons in a midbrain organoid model of PD.\nMethods: Wild-type (GBA+/+), N370S mutant (GBA+/N370), and GBA1 knockout (GBA-/-) astrocytes were rapidly and directly induced from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) via transcription factor-based differentiation. These astrocytes were extensively characterized for GCase-dependent phenotypes using immunocytochemistry, organoid coculture, enzymatic assays, lipid tracers, transcriptomics, and lipidomics.\nResults: hPSC lines were rapidly induced into astrocytes and enzymatic assays confirmed that GBA-/- astrocytes completely lacked GCase activity, while GBA+/N370 preserved partial activity. GBA-/-, but not GBA+/N370S, exhibited lysosomal alterations, with enlarged lysosomes and glucosylceramide (GlcCer) accumulation. GCase deficiency also exacerbated TNF-alpha-induced secretion of the inflammatory biomarker, CCL2. In midbrain organoids, GCase activity did not modulate the ability of astrocytes to support dopamine neuron production and survival. Lipidomics revealed a GBA-/--specific increase in sphingomyelin, and a decrease of triglycerides. Direct rescue of GCase activity with GBA1 mRNA treatment reduced GlcCer accumulation. Astrocytes exhibited a relatively high uptake and storage of fatty acid analogs as lipid droplets, in comparison to neurons, and this process was impaired in GBA-/- astrocytes. Lastly, GBA-/- astrocytes accumulate neuronal membrane-derived GlcCer. These findings highlight the critical role of astrocytic GCase in lipid metabolism and its neuronal influence.\nConclusion: GCase deficiency does not inhibit human astrocyte differentiation nor cause a non-cell autonomous neurotoxic effect upon dopaminergic neurons within midbrain organoids. However, it does elicit enhanced inflammatory reactivity, accumulation of GlcCer, and a distinct lipidomic profile, indicating impaired lipid metabolism in astrocytes that can dysregulate neuron-astrocyte intercellular signaling. Overall, these insights underscore dysfunctional astrocyte lipid metabolism as a high priority therapeutic target in Parkinson's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders."

    "abstract": "Background: A significant proportion of individuals maintain healthy cognitive function despite having extensive Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, known as cognitive resilience. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that protect these individuals can identify therapeutic targets for AD dementia. This study aims to define molecular and cellular signatures of cognitive resilience, protection and resistance, by integrating genetics, bulk RNA, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data across multiple brain regions from AD, resilient, and control individuals.\nMethods: We analyzed data from the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), including bulk (n=631) and multi-regional single nucleus (n=48) RNA sequencing. Subjects were categorized into AD, resilient, and control based on β-amyloid and tau pathology, and cognitive status. We identified and prioritized protected cell populations using whole genome sequencing-derived genetic variants, transcriptomic profiling, and cellular composition distribution.\nResults: Transcriptomic results, supported by GWAS-derived polygenic risk scores, place cognitive resilience as an intermediate state in the AD continuum. Tissue-level analysis revealed 43 genes enriched in nucleic acid metabolism and signaling that were differentially expressed between AD and resilience. Only GFAP (upregulated) and KLF4 (downregulated) showed differential expression in resilience compared to controls. Cellular resilience involved reorganization of protein folding and degradation pathways, with downregulation of Hsp90 and selective upregulation of Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp110 families in excitatory neurons. Excitatory neuronal subpopulations in the entorhinal cortex (ATP8B1+ and MEF2Chigh) exhibited unique resilience signaling through neurotrophin (modulated by LINGO1) and angiopoietin (ANGPT2/TEK) pathways. We identified MEF2C, ATP8B1, and RELN as key markers of resilient excitatory neuronal populations, characterized by selective vulnerability in AD. Protective rare variant enrichment highlighted vulnerable populations, including somatostatin (SST) inhibitory interneurons, validated through immunofluorescence showing co-expression of rare variant associated RBFOX1 and KIF26B in SST+ neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The maintenance of excitatory-inhibitory balance emerges as a key characteristic of resilience.\nConclusions: We identified molecular and cellular hallmarks of cognitive resilience, an intermediate state in the AD continuum. Resilience mechanisms include preservation of neuronal function, maintenance of excitatory/inhibitory balance, and activation of protective signaling pathways. Specific excitatory neuronal populations appear to play a central role in mediating cognitive resilience, while a subset of vulnerable SST interneurons likely provide compensation against AD-associated dysregulation. This study offers a framework to leverage natural protective mechanisms to mitigate neurodegeneration and preserve cognition in AD."

    "abstract": "As the principal lipid transporter in the human brain, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is tasked with the transport and protection of highly vulnerable lipids required to support and remodel neuronal membranes, in a process that is dependent on ApoE receptors. Human APOE allele variants that encode proteins differing only in the number of cysteine (Cys)-to-arginine (Arg) exchanges (ApoE2 [2 Cys], ApoE3 [1 Cys], ApoE4 [0 Cys]) comprise the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the specific molecular feature(s) and resultant mechanisms that underlie these isoform-dependent effects are unknown. One signature feature of Cys is the capacity to form disulfide (Cys-Cys) bridges, which are required to form disulfide bridge-linked dimers and multimers. Here we propose the overarching hypothesis that the super-ability (for ApoE2), intermediate ability (for ApoE3) or inability (for ApoE4) to form lipid-protecting intermolecular disulfide bridges, is the central molecular determinant accounting for the disparate effects of APOE alleles on AD risk and amyloid-β and Tau pathologies in humans. We posit that presence and abundance of Cys in human ApoE3 and ApoE2 respectively, conceal and protect vulnerable lipids transported by ApoE from peroxidation by enabling formation of ApoE homo-dimers/multimers and heteromeric ApoE complexes such as ApoE-ApoJ and ApoE-ApoD. We thus propose that the inability to form intermolecular disulfide bridges makes ApoE4-containing lipoproteins uniquely vulnerable to peroxidation and its downstream consequences. Consistent with our model, we found that brain-enriched polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids induce disulfide-dependent dimerization and multimerization of ApoE3 and ApoE2 (but not ApoE4). By contrast, incubation with the peroxidation-resistant lipid DMPC or cholesterol alone had minimal effects on dimerization. These novel concepts and findings are integrated into our unifying model implicating peroxidation of ApoE-containing lipoproteins, with consequent ApoE receptor-ligand disruption, as the initiating molecular events that ultimately lead to AD in humans.\nHighlights: APOE alleles are the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) APOE alleles encode proteins that differ only in the number of Cys⟶Arg exchanges Despite 30 years of inquiry, mechanisms linking Cys⟶Arg exchanges to AD remain unknownPUFA-phospholipids induced disulfide bridge formation in ApoE3 and ApoE2 (but not ApoE4)We hypothesize that disulfide bridges in ApoE protect vulnerable lipids from peroxidation We propose that lipid-protecting disulfide bridges explain APOE allele-dependent AD risks."

    "abstract": "Compartmentalization of the nucleus into heterochromatin and euchromatin is highly conserved across eukaryotes. Constitutive heterochromatin (C-Het) constitutes a liquid-like condensate that packages the repetitive regions of the genome through the enrichment of histone modification H3K9me3 and recruitment of its cognate reader protein Heterochromatin Protein-1 (HP1a). The ability for well-ordered nucleosome arrays and HP1a to independently form biomolecular condensates suggests that the emergent material properties of C-Het compartments may contribute to its functions such as force-buffering, dosage-dependent gene silencing, and selective permeability. Using an in vitro reconstitution system we directly assess the contributions of H3K9me3 and HP1a on the biophysical properties of C-Het. In the presence of HP1a, H3K9me3 (Me-) and unmodified (U-) chromatin form co-condensates composed of distinct, immiscible domains. These chromatin domains form spontaneously and are reversible. Independently of HP1a, H3K9me3 modifications are sufficient to increase linker-DNA length within chromatin arrays and slow chromatin condensate growth. HP1a increases the liquidity of chromatin condensates while dramatically differentiating the viscoelastic properties of Me-chromatin versus U-chromatin. Mutating key residues in HP1a show that HP1a interactions with itself and chromatin determine the relative interfacial tension between chromatin compartments, however the formation of condensates is driven by the underlying chromatin. These direct measurements map the energetic landscape that determines C-Het compartmentalization, demonstrating that nuclear compartmentalization is a spontaneous and energetically favorable process in which HP1a plays a critical role in establishing a hierarchy of affinities between H3K9me3-chromatin and unmodified-chromatin.\nHighlights: ⍰ HP1a is necessary and sufficient for heterochromatin compartmentalization.⍰ Heterochromatin compartmentalization is reversible and proceeds through microphase-separation.⍰ H3K9me3 is sufficient to change nucleosome-array dynamics and mesoscale material properties.⍰ HP1a increases chromatin liquidity.⍰ HP1a-chromatin interaction modes tune the interfacial tensions and morphologies of heterochromatin compartments."

    "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by a decline in neovascularization potential and increased susceptibility to ischemic injury. Here, we confirm the age-related impaired neovascularization following ischemic leg injury and impaired angiogenesis. The age-related deficits in angiogenesis arose primarily from diminished EC proliferation capacity, but not migration or VEGF sensitivity. Aged EC harvested from the mouse skeletal muscle displayed a pro-angiogenic gene expression phenotype, along with considerable changes in metabolic genes. Metabolomics analysis and 13C glucose tracing revealed impaired ATP production and blockade in glycolysis and TCA cycle in late passage HUVECs, which occurred at nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺)-dependent steps, along with NAD+ depletion. Supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD⁺, enhances late-passage EC proliferation and sprouting angiogenesis from aged mice aortas. Taken together, our study illustrates the importance of NAD+-dependent metabolism in the maintenance of EC proliferation capacity with age, and the therapeutic potential of NAD precursors."

    "abstract": "Alpha-kinase 1 (ALPK1) is an immune receptor sensing the bacterial nucleotide sugar ADP-heptose. ALPK1 phosphorylates TIFA leading to its oligomerization and downstream NF-κB activation. Specific mutations in ALPK1 are associated with an autoinflammatory syndrome termed ROSAH and with spiradenoma (skin cancers with sweat gland differentiation). This study investigated ALPK1 responses in human mononuclear cells and demonstrates that human mononuclear cells have distinct abilities to respond to ADP-heptose. Notably, IFN-γ is required to license the ALPK1/TIFA pathway in monocytes, while it was dispensable for the responsiveness of B cells. IFN-γ induced TIFA upregulation in monocytes, and TIFA induction was sufficient to recapitulate the licensing effect of IFN-γ. IFN-γ treatment promoted the phenotypic expression of pathogenic ALPK1 mutations. The licensing effect of IFN-γ in monocytes was blocked by JAK inhibitors. These findings underscore the critical role of IFN-γ in ALPK1 function and suggest JAK inhibitors as potential therapies for ALPK1-related inflammatory conditions."

Recent works have highlighted the role of YAP1/TEAD activity in several cancers and its potential therapeutic implications. Therefore, identifying patients with a dysregulated Hippo pathway is key to enhancing treatment impact. Although recent studies have derived RNA-seq-based signatures, there remains a need for a reproducible and cost-effective method to measure the pathway activation. In recent years, deep learning applied to histology slides have emerged as an effective way to predict molecular information from a data modality available in clinical routine. Here, we trained models to predict YAP1/TEAD activity from H&E-stained histology slides in multiple cancers. The robustness of our approach was assessed in seven independent validation cohorts.

However, data for clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with undiagnosed, early-stage CKD are lacking.\nMethods: REVEAL-CKD is a multinational, observational study using real-world data in selected countries to describe factors associated with undiagnosed stage 3 CKD, time to diagnosis, and CKD management post diagnosis. We analysed patient data from 20 hospitals in the China Renal Data System. Adult patients with two consecutive estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements indicating stage 3 CKD (30-<60 ml/min/1.73 m2) recorded >90-730 days apart from 2015 to 2020 were eligible.\nFindings: Among 35,222 eligible patients, 25,214 (71.6%) were undiagnosed (lacked a CKD diagnostic code before and up to six months post-second-qualifying-eGFR). Only 2344 (9.3%) undiagnosed patients eventually received a delayed diagnosis, whose median time to diagnosis was 18.1 (95% CI: 17.6-18.8) months. Age ≥65 years, being female, stage 3A CKD, and the absence of nephrology visit and comorbidities (diabetes, established cardiovascular disease, heart failure, hypertension, or chronic nephritic syndrome) were associated with undiagnosed CKD (P < 0.001). Among the diagnosed patients, the proportion receiving ≥1 prescription of guideline-recommended medications (e.g. renin-angiotensin system inhibitors) increased and their eGFR decline attenuated post-diagnosis.\nInterpretation: The high proportion of undiagnosed, early-stage CKD, and delayed diagnosis are concerning. The improved prescription patterns and the attenuation of eGFR decline post-diagnosis demonstrate the importance of early diagnosis and timely intervention in CKD patients.\nFunding: AstraZeneca China."

This issue is well defined in asthma but is less well understood in COPD. The aim of this study was to examine cumulative OCS dispensed to people with COPD over 12 months.\nPatients and methods: This was a secondary analysis of data from two randomised controlled trials involving people with COPD followed up for 12 months following pulmonary rehabilitation. Clinical and administrative (respiratory-related hospital admissions and emergency presentations, dispensed OCS and COPD maintenance medications) data were examined to determine cumulative OCS dose relative to the 1000mg threshold and the relationship with clinical features.\nResults: Of 232 participants (126 females, age mean 68 ± SD 9 years, FEV1 53 ± 22% predicted), 48% (n = 112) were dispensed OCS at least once over 12 months. Sixty-two participants (26%) were dispensed ≥1000mg. Participants with a high cumulative dose were more likely to have had a respiratory admission (OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.3 to 8.7) and greater breathlessness (modified Medical Research Council scale ≥2, OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.0); no relationship with disease severity or maintenance medications was demonstrated.\nConclusion: One in four people with COPD were dispensed unsafe lifetime cumulative OCS doses over a period of only 12 months.

Given the high prevalence of comorbidities among these disorders, we conducted an umbrella review to comprehensively assess the efficacy of BSTs in treating the core symptoms across these three categories of disorders.\nMethods: We systematically searched for meta-analyses and network meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with sham controls up to September 25, 2024, from databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Our primary outcome was improvements in core symptoms. We evaluated quality using 11 criteria.

This study provided a comprehensive analysis of the burden of asthma.\nMethods: Data on asthma were extracted from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021. We focused on the effects of age, sex, risk factors, and the socio-demographic index (SDI) on the burden of asthma and calculated the average annual percent change (AAPC) via joinpoint regression. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was adopted to estimate the causal relationships between risk factors and asthma. The Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model was used to predict incidence patterns of asthma from 2022 to 2050.\nFindings: In 2021, there was an observed prevalence of asthma, with 3,340 cases per 100,000 people. Males who were below 20 years old had a greater prevalence of asthma. The incidence and prevalence correlated positively with the SDI, whereas mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) correlated negatively. The contribution of high body mass index (BMI) to asthma DALYs increased by 4.3% worldwide between 1990 and 2021. MR studies have confirmed that high BMI and smoking can increase the risk of asthma. The prediction results indicated that the global age-standardised incidence rate will remain high from 2022 to 2050.\nInterpretation: The global mortality of patients with asthma is a significant concern. The analysis of the burden of asthma can help formulate public health policies, allocate resources, and prevent asthma.\nFunding: This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China; Program for Young Talents of Basic Research in Universities of Heilongjiang Province; Marshal Initiative Funding; Mathematical Tianyuan Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China; XingLian Outstanding Talent Support Program 2024."

In language-eloquent tumours and in awake craniotomy techniques regardless of tumour functional eloquence, POM&IONM group had higher GTR when compared to IONM groups (language eloquent tumours-POM&IONM 43.31% versus IONM-15.09%, p = 0.022; awake craniotomy technique-POM&IONM-41.22% versus IONM-12.08%, p = 0.0006). Permanent FNDs were higher in the IONM group (IONM-73.0%; POM-29.6%; POM&IONM-33.7% of immediate postoperative deficits, p = 0.0010).\nInterpretation: A combined POM&IONM approach is responsible for higher rates of GTR in patients with language eloquent tumours and in both awake and asleep craniotomy techniques regardless of the tumour functional eloquence. The tumour histology is not relevant for differences in GTR rates among different mapping and monitoring strategies. Permanent postoperative FNDs are more likely with standalone utilization of IONM.\nFunding: Not applicable."

    "heading": "Inflammation and Immune Escape in Ovarian Cancer: Pathways and Therapeutic Opportunities",
    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) remains one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies, largely due to its late-stage diagnosis and high recurrence rates. Chronic inflammation is a critical driver of OC progression, contributing to immune evasion, tumor growth, and metastasis. Inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8, as well as key signaling pathways such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), are upregulated in OC, promoting a tumor-promoting environment. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is characterized by immune cells like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), which suppress anti-tumor immune responses, facilitating immune evasion. Furthermore, OC cells utilize immune checkpoint pathways, including PD-1/PD-L1, to inhibit cytotoxic T cell activity. Targeting these inflammatory and immune evasion mechanisms offers promising therapeutic strategies. COX-2 inhibitors, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway blockers, and NF-kB inhibitors have shown potential in preclinical studies, while immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 have been explored with mixed results in OC. Additionally, emerging research on the microbiome and inflammation-related biomarkers, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and exosomes, points to new opportunities for early detection and precision medicine. Future approaches to OC treatment must focus on personalized strategies that target the inflammatory TME, integrating anti-inflammatory therapies with immunotherapy to enhance patient outcomes. Continued research into the interplay between inflammation and immune evasion in OC is essential for developing effective, long-lasting treatments."

    "abstract": "Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer, characterized by frequent recurrence, metastasis, and poor survival outcomes despite chemotherapy-based treatments. This study aims to investigate the mechanisms by which Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) modulates the tumor immune microenvironment in TNBC, utilizing CiteSpace and bioinformatics analysis.\nMethods: We employed CiteSpace to analyze treatment hotspots and key TCM formulations, followed by bioinformatics analysis to identify the main active components, targets, associated pathways, and their clinical implications in TNBC treatment.\nResults: CiteSpace analysis highlighted key TCM formulations, including Sanhuang Decoction. Network pharmacology identified major bioactive components such as Mutatochrome, Physcion diglucoside, Procyanidin B-5,3'-O-gallate, gallic acid-3-O-(6'-O-galloyl)-glucoside, and isomucronulatol-7,2'-di-O-glucosiole, with core targets including Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK1), Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2), and Lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK). These targets were found to be involved in immune regulation, particularly the modulation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Additionally, core targets were associated with improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in TNBC patients.\nConclusion: The therapeutic effects of TCM in TNBC primarily involve immune modulation within the tumor microenvironment, particularly through the regulation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells."

    "abstract": "While durable antibody responses from long-lived plasma cell (LLPC) populations are important for protection against pathogens, LLPC may be harmful if they produce antibodies against self-proteins or self-nuclear antigens as occurs in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Thus, the elimination of autoreactive LLPC may improve the treatment of antibody-driven autoimmune diseases. However, LLPC remain a challenging therapeutic target. Here, we compare the matched bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PBL) plasma cell (PC) compartments of SLE and healthy donors (HD). We show a similar distribution of CD138- and CD138+ PC, including putative LLPC (CD19- CD138+ CD38+), between SLE and HD BM. For both SLE and HD, CD138+ PC are at a higher frequency in BM than PBL. Expression of Ki-67 associates with the PBL compartment where it is found on all PC subsets regardless of CD19 or CD138 expression. Transcriptomic analysis identifies an interferon (IFN) gene signature in transitional B cells in the SLE BM, but surprisingly also in the BM PC derived from SLE. BM PC and B cells phosphorylate STAT1 in response to type I IFN stimulation in vitro, but with decreased fold change compared to those from the PBL. While BM PC bind type I IFN receptor-blocking antibody anifrolumab, it is to a lesser degree than circulating B cells. Anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANA) are found in the BM supernatant and PBL serum of SLE patients. Both SLE and HD BM-derived PC have increased survival compared to their PBL counterparts when treated with verdinexor. In summary, these findings show evidence of IFN activation in BM PC from SLE."

The management of LAPC remains a complex issue, particularly in patients who are not eligible for surgical resection.\nCase: Here, we report the case of a 60-year-old woman diagnosed with LAPC through pathological biopsy who subsequently underwent targeted immunotherapy following the failure of a gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and S-1 (G&S) chemotherapy regimen.\nIntervention: Based on next-generation sequencing (NGS), the patient's treatment regimen was adjusted to include albumin-bound paclitaxel and capecitabine chemotherapy, along with the PD-1 inhibitor camrelizumab (200 mg/cycle) for six cycles. Throughout the treatment period, the patient consistently declined surgical intervention. Imaging studies, including an upper abdominal computed tomography (CT), revealed the formation of a calcified layer surrounding the cancerous tissue in the pancreatic head. Remarkably, the patient has shown stable disease and no evidence of metastasis since the initiation of targeted immunotherapy.\nConclusion: This case highlights the potential of targeted immunotherapy for the treatment of LAPC, particularly in non-surgical patients. A personalized approach guided by NGS, combined with immunotherapy, is an effective alternative to traditional treatment strategies for managing this challenging malignancy."

    "abstract": "Introduction: HIV-1 exploits dendritic cells (DCs) to spread throughout the body via specific recognition of gangliosides present on the viral envelope by the CD169/Siglec-1 membrane receptor. This interaction triggers the internalization of HIV-1 within a structure known as the sac-like compartment. While the mechanism underlying sac-like compartment formation remains elusive, prior research indicates that the process is clathrin-independent and cell membrane cholesterol-dependent and involves transient disruption of cortical actin. Here, we investigate the potential involvement of massive endocytosis (MEND) in this process.\nMethods: We used live cell confocal imaging to measure the dimensions and dynamics of the compartment. We assessed the role of actin and cholesterol in fixed and live cells using confocal microscopy and evaluated the effect of PI3K and protein palmytoilation inhibitors during viral uptake.\nResults: Our data demonstrate extensive plasma membrane invagination based on sac-like compartment dimensions (2.9 μm in diameter and 20 μm3 in volume). We showed that the cholesterol concentration doubles within the regions of viral uptake, suggesting lipid-phase separation, and that development of the sac-like compartment is accompanied by transient depolarization of cortical actin. Moreover, we observed that protein palmitoylation and PI3K inhibition reduce the sac-like compartment formation rate from 70% to 20% and 40%, respectively.\nConclusions: Our results indicate the involvement of MEND mechanisms during sac-like compartment formation."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Macrophages exhibit marked phenotypic heterogeneity within and across disease states, with lipid metabolic reprogramming contributing to macrophage activation and heterogeneity. Chronic inflammation has been observed in human benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues, however macrophage activation states and their contributions to this hyperplastic disease have not been defined. We postulated that a shift in macrophage phenotypes with increasing prostate size could involve metabolic alterations resulting in prostatic epithelial or stromal hyperplasia.\nMethods: Single-cell RNA-seq of CD45+ transition zone leukocytes from 10 large (>90 grams) and 10 small (<40 grams) human prostates was conducted. Macrophage subpopulations were defined using marker genes and evaluated by flow cytometry.\nResults: BPH macrophages do not distinctly categorize into M1 and M2 phenotypes. Instead, macrophages with neither polarization signature preferentially accumulate in large versus small prostates. Specifically, macrophage subpopulations with altered lipid metabolism pathways, demarcated by TREM2 and MARCO expression, accumulate with increased prostate volume. TREM2 high and MARCO high macrophage abundance positively correlates with patient body mass index and urinary symptom scores. TREM2high macrophages have a statistically significant increase in neutral lipid compared to TREM2low macrophages from BPH tissues. Lipid-rich macrophages were observed to localize within the stroma in BPH tissues. In vitro studies indicate that lipid-loaded macrophages increase prostate epithelial and stromal cell proliferation compared to control macrophages.\nDiscussion: These data define two new BPH immune subpopulations, TREM2high and MARCOhigh macrophages, and suggest that lipid-rich macrophages may exacerbate lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with large prostates. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of targeting these cells in BPH."

Currently, the inflammatory cardiovascular risk is assessed via C-reactive protein (CRP) levels measured using a high-sensitivity assay (hsCRP). Monomeric CRP (mCRP) is a locally produced form of CRP that has emerged as a potential biomarker of inflammation.\nAim: This study investigated whether mCRP levels are associated with premature CAD.\nMaterials and methods: This study comprised 103 participants of both sexes, including 50 patients 56 ± 7 years old with premature CAD and 53 patients 51 ± 10 years old without CAD. CAD was verified using coronary angiography, hsCRP levels were measured using a standard assay, and mCRP levels were measured using fluorescent cytometric beads conjugated with an anti-mCRP antibody.\nResults: The levels of hsCRP were 0.99 (0.59; 3.10) mg/L vs. 0.63 (0.35; 1.85) mg/L (p = 0.067), and mCRP 6.84 (4.20; 13.78) µg/L vs. 2.57 (0.32; 5.66) µg/L (p <0.001) in patients with CAD vs. patients without CAD, respectively. There was a weak positive correlation between the mCRP and hsCRP levels (ρ = 0.214; p = 0.030). hsCRP levels were below 2.0 mg/L (i.e., residual inflammatory cardiovascular risk should have been excluded) in 70% of patients with CAD and 79% of patients without CAD (p = 0.365). mCRP levels differed between the groups of patients with hsCRP levels below 2.0 mg/L: 5.14 (4.07; 10.68) µg/L vs. 2.77 (0.53; 5.00) µg/L in patients with or without CAD, respectively (p <0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that mCRP levels were independently associated with premature CAD. The adjusted odds ratio was 1.18 (95% CI 1.06-1.33, p = 0.004) per each µg/L increase in mCRP levels.\nConclusion: Higher mCRP levels were associated with premature CAD, independent of hsCRP levels and traditional risk factors."

Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various telitacicept doses in SLE treatment.\nMethods: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane libraries, Web of science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, Wanfang, and Sinomed were searched for the controlled trials that studied the efficacy and safety of telitacicept on SLE patients from their initiation to April 30, 2024. The analysis included three randomized controlled trials (RCT) with 606 participants. We used fixed-effects models for meta-analyses and the risk ratios (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety. Heterogeneity was assessed and quantified using I2.\nResults: All telitacicept dosages (80 mg, 160 mg, 240 mg) significantly improved SLE Responder Index 4 (SRI4) responses compared to the control group (RR = 2.20, 95%CI:1.50-3.21, p < 0.0001; RR = 2.18, 95%CI: 1.82-2.62, p < 0.00001; RR = 2.44, 95%CI: 1.67-3.56, p < 0.00001, respectively).

    "abstract": "Obesity is a rapidly growing health problem worldwide, affecting both adults and children and increasing the risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In addition, obesity is closely linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD) by either exacerbating diabetic complications or directly causing kidney damage. Obesity-related CKD is characterized by proteinuria, lipid accumulation, fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis, which can gradually impair kidney function. Among the immune cells of the innate and adaptive immune response involved in the pathogenesis of obesity-related diseases, macrophages play a crucial role in the inflammation associated with CKD. In obese individuals, macrophages enter a pro-inflammatory state known as M1 polarization, which contributes to chronic inflammation. This polarization promotes tissue damage, inflammation and fibrosis, leading to progressive loss of kidney function. In addition, macrophage-induced oxidative stress is a key feature of CKD as it also promotes cell damage and inflammation. Macrophages also contribute to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes by releasing inflammatory molecules that impair glucose metabolism, complicating the management of diabetes in obese patients. Hypertension and atherosclerosis, which are often associated with obesity, also contribute to the progression of CKD via immune and inflammatory pathways. Macrophages influence blood pressure regulation and contribute to vascular inflammation, particularly via the renin-angiotensin system. In atherosclerosis, macrophages accumulate in arterial plaques, leading to chronic inflammation and plaque instability, which may increase the risk of CVD in CKD patients. This review focuses on the involvement of macrophages in CKD and highlights their role as a critical link between CKD and other pathologies. Targeting macrophage polarization and the ensuing macrophage-induced inflammation could be an effective therapeutic strategy for CKD and related diseases and improve outcomes for patients with obesity-related kidney disease."

This study aims to investigate the association between complete blood cell count (CBC)-derived inflammatory indicators and gallstones in adults under 60 years of age in the United States.\nMethods: This cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2017 to 2020. Associations between CBC-derived inflammatory biomarkers and gallstones were assessed using multivariable logistic regression models, with results presented as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to examine potential non-linear relationships. Subgroup analyses were also conducted to explore differences across population subgroups.\nResults: This study comprised 4,977 participants, among whom 398 were diagnosed with gallstones. After adjusting for confounding variables, the highest quartile of systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) [OR (95%CI): 1.65(1.12,2.43)], systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) [OR (95%CI): 1.53(1.05,2.25)], monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) [OR (95%CI): 1.66(1.16,2.37)], and pan immune inflammatory value (PIV) [OR (95%CI): 1.82(1.23,2.71)] were associated with a significantly increased risk of gallstones compared to the lowest quartiles. RCS plots indicated a nonlinear relationship between several inflammatory biomarkers and gallstones.\nConclusion: Our study found that SIRI, SII, MLR, and PIV can serve as clinical indicators for predicting the risk of gallstones in adults under 60 years of age in the United States."

    "abstract": "Background: Bladder cancer (BCa) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, and its prognostication and treatment remains challenging. The fast growth of various cancer cells requires reprogramming of its energy metabolism using aerobic glycolysis as a major energy source. However, the prognostic and therapeutic value of glycolysis-related genes in BCa remains to be determined.\nMethods: The fused merge dateset from TCGA, GSE13507 and GSE31684 were used for the analysis of glycolysis-related genes expression or subtyping; and corresponding clinical data of these BCa patients were also collected. In the merge cohort, we constructed a 18 multigene signature using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model. The four external cohorts (i.e., IMvigor210, GSE32894, GSE48276 and GSE48075) of BCa patients were used to validate the accuracy. We evaluated immune infiltration using seven published algorithms: CIBERSORT, QUANTISEQ, XCELL, TIMER, CIBERSORT-ABS, EPIC, and MCPCOUNTER. Subsequently, in order to analyze the correlation between risk groups(scores) and overall survival, recognised immunoregolatory cells or common chemotherapeutic agents, clinicopathological data and immune checkpoint-related genes of BCa patients, Wilcox rank test, chi-square test, cox regression and spearman's correlation were performed.\nResults: Conspicuously, we could see that CD8+ T, cancer associated fibroblast, macrophage M2, NK, endothelial cells and so on were significantly dysregulated between the two risk groups. In addition, compared with the low-risk group, high-risk group predicted poor prognosis and relatively weak sensitivity of chemotherapy. Additionally, we also found that the expression level of partial genes in the model was significantly correlated with objective responses to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 treatment in the IMvigor210, GSE111636, GSE176307, GSE78220 or GSE67501 cohort; and its expression level was also varied in different objective response cases receiving tislelizumab combined with low-dose nab-paclitaxel therapy based on our mRNA sequencing (TRUCE-01). According to \"GSEA\" algorithm of R package \"clusterProfiler\", the most significantly enriched HALLMARK, KEGG pathway and GO term was separately the 'Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition', 'Ecm Receptor Interaction' and 'MF_Extracellular_matrix_structural_constitunet' in the high- vs. low-risk group. Subsequently, we verified the protein and mRNA expression of interested model-related genes from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and 10 paired BCa tissues collected by us. Furthermore, in vitro functional experiments demonstrated that FASN was a functional oncogene in BCa cells through promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities.\nConclusion: In summary, the glycolysis-associated gene signature established by us exhibited a high predictive performance for the prognosis, immunotherapeutic responsiveness, and chemotherapeutic sensitivity of BCa. And, The model also might function as a chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment guidance."

Desensitization using imlifidase, which is more rapid and removes total body immunoglobulin G (IgG) to a greater extent than other methods, enables transplantation to occur between HLA-incompatible (HLAi) donor-recipient pairs and allows patients to have greater access to KTx. However, when the project was launched there was limited data and clinical experience with desensitization in general and with imlifidase specifically. Hence, this Delphi methodology was used to reach a consensus from a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) of experts from 15 countries on the management of HS patients undergoing imlifidase HLAi from a deceased donor (DD) KTx. This Delphi consensus provides clinical practice guidance on the use of imlifidase in the end-to-end management of HS patients undergoing an HLAi DD KTx and supports centers in the development of guidelines for the utilization and integration of imlifidase into clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to assess the protective effect of a clinical dose esketamine on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and to reveal the potential mechanisms associated with microglial polarization and autophagy.\nMethods: Experimental cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in adult rats and simulated by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in BV-2 microglial cells. Neurological and sensorimotor function, cerebral infarct volume, histopathological changes, mitochondrial morphological changes, and apoptosis of ischemic brain tissues were assessed in the presence or absence of esketamine and the autophagy inducer rapamycin. The expression of biomarkers related to microglial M1 and M2 phenotypes in the ischemic brain tissues was determined by immunofluorescence staining and RT-qPCR, and the expression of proteins associated with autophagy and the AKT signaling pathway in the ischemic brain tissues was assayed by Western blotting.\nResults: Esketamine alone and esketamine combined with rapamycin alleviated neurological impairment, improved sensorimotor function, decreased cerebral infarct volume, and mitigated tissue injury in the MCAO rats. Importantly, esketamine promoted microglial phenotypic transition from M1 to M2 in both the MCAO rats and the OGD-treated BV-2 microglia, induced autophagy, and inactivated AKT signaling. Furthermore, the effects of esketamine were enhanced by addition of autophagy inducer rapamycin.\nConclusion: Esketamine at a clinical dose attenuates cerebral I/R injury by inhibiting AKT signaling pathway to facilitate microglial M2 polarization and autophagy. Furthermore, esketamine combined autophagy inducer can provide an improved protection against cerebral I/R injury. Thus, this study provides new insights into the neuroprotective mechanisms of esketamine and the potential therapeutic strategies of cerebral I/R injury."

Substitution analyses were also performed.\nFindings: Overall, 428,728 (71.7% female) participants were included in the analysis and 40,016 deaths were documented after 15.9 years of follow-up. UPFs (in percentage grams per day [g/d]) were positively associated with all-cause mortality (HRs per 1-SD: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02,1.05), as well as mortality from circulatory diseases (1.09; 95% CI: 1.07,1.12), cerebrovascular disease (1.11; 95% CI: 1.05,1.17), ischemic heart disease (1.10; 95% CI: 1.06,1.15), digestive diseases (1.12; 95% CI: 1.05,1.20), and Parkinson's disease (1.23; 95% CI: 1.06,1.42). No associations were found between UPFs and mortality from cancer or Alzheimer's disease. Replacing processed and UPFs with unprocessed/minimally processed foods was associated with lower mortality risk.\nInterpretation: In this pan-European analysis, higher UPF consumption was associated with greater mortality from circulatory diseases, digestive diseases, and Parkinson's disease. The results support growing evidence that higher consumption of UPFs and lower consumption of unprocessed foods may have a negative impact on health.\nFunding: l'Institut National du Cancer, and World Cancer Research Fund International."

    "abstract": "In recent years, new anticancer drugs have been investigated and approved for the treatment of breast cancer based on improved survival outcomes. However, these new treatments have specific class-related side effects. Pulmonary toxicity has been identified as an adverse event of special interest with everolimus, and is becoming an increasingly significant clinical challenge with the recent approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan. Overall, the risk of pulmonary toxicity is quite low but in some cases lung damage can be fatal. We conducted an update including the available published data regarding the incidence, mechanisms of pathogenesis, clinical presentations, and treatment of lung toxicity induced by new anticancer drugs. A literature search was performed between January and June 2024, considering papers, clinical trials, case reports, case series, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews published from January 2014 to June 2024. We also provide an algorithm for diagnosis and treatment, along with real-life cases managed at the Modena Cancer Center. Data provided here show that pulmonary toxicity is a quite frequent side effect and underline that early recognition and prompt treatment are crucial for the best outcome of patients, whose overall prognosis is being improved by the availability of these new anticancer agents."

    "abstract": "Background: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used, including among cancer patients, to manage gastroesophageal reflux and other gastric acid-related disorders. Recent evidence suggests associations between long-term PPI use and higher risks for various adverse health outcomes, including greater mortality.\nAim: To investigate the association between PPI use and all-cause mortality among cancer patients by a comprehensive analysis after adjustment for various confounders and a robust methodological approach to minimize bias.\nMethods: This retrospective cohort study used data from the TriNetX research network, with electronic health records from multiple healthcare organizations. The study employed a new-user, active comparator design, which compared newly treated PPI users with non-users and newly treated histamine2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) users among adult cancer patients. Newly prescribed PPIs (esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, or rabeprazole) users were compared to non-users or newly prescribed H2RAs (cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, or ranitidine) users. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Each patient in the main group was matched to a patient in the control group using 1:1 propensity score matching to reduce confounding effects. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI).\nResults: During the follow-up period (median 5.4 ± 1.8 years for PPI users and 6.5 ± 1.0 years for non-users), PPI users demonstrated a higher all-cause mortality rate than non-users after 1 year, 2 years, and at the end of follow up (HRs: 2.34-2.72). Compared with H2RA users, PPI users demonstrated a higher rate of all-cause mortality HR: 1.51 (95%CI: 1.41-1.69). Similar results were observed across sensitivity analyses by excluding deaths from the first 9 months and 1-year post-exposure, confirming the robustness of these findings. In a sensitivity analysis, we analyzed all-cause mortality outcomes between former PPI users and individuals who have never used PPIs, providing insights into the long-term effects of past PPI use. In addition, at 1-year follow-up, the analysis revealed a significant difference in mortality rates between former PPI users and non-users (HR: 1.84; 95%CI: 1.82-1.96).\nConclusion: PPI use among cancer patients was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to non-users or H2RA users. These findings emphasize the need for cautious use of PPIs in cancer patients and suggest that alternative treatments should be considered when clinically feasible. However, further studies are needed to corroborate our findings, given the significant adverse outcomes in cancer patients."

    "abstract": "Background: Despite advancements in the therapeutic armamentarium for Crohn's disease (CD), biologic and small molecule monotherapies are associated with sub-optimal response and remission rates. Utilizing dual biologic therapy (DBT) holds the potential to increase efficacy in the treatment of refractory or partially responsive CD. Evidence pertaining to this strategy remains limited.\nMethods: We retrospectively examined refractory CD patients treated with a combination of ustekinumab and vedolizumab. Outcomes to DBT at week (wk) 52 were compared to monotherapy. The primary outcome constituted corticosteroid-free remission. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, infections, hospitalizations, surgeries, treatment persistence, and disease clearance.\nResults: Sixteen of 21 active refractory CD patients (76%) on DBT achieved disease remission at wk 52. Mucosal healing was observed in 38% (n = 6), biochemical remission in 25% (n = 4), and both clinical and biochemical remission in 38% (n = 6). Of these patients, 50% (n = 8) achieved corticosteroid-free remission. Three patients (37.5%) with corticosteroid-free remission achieved complete disease clearance. Paired median fecal calprotectin decreased from 508 to 118 µg/g (P < .0001). Paired C-reactive protein median decreased from 1.04 to 0.50 mg/dL (P < .0001). Median Harvey Bradshaw Index score reduced from 7 to 2 (P = .003). Endoscopic healing was achieved with a paired simple endoscopic score for CD decrease from 6 to 3 (P = .013). Corticosteroid dependency reduced from 17 to 8 patients discontinuing altogether. Patients still requiring corticosteroids experienced a decrease in average daily dose from 9 to 6 mg (P = .045). At wk 52, 5 patients (24%) did not meet the criteria for remission with 4 requiring CD-related surgical intervention. Mean CD-related hospitalizations reduced from 2.95 ± 2.33 to 0.52 ± 1.12 (P < .001) and surgeries from 1.76 ± 1.3 to 0.14 ± 0.4 (P < .001). Three infections with 1 requiring hospitalization and 1 report of headache were noted. Two patients discontinued DBT.\nConclusions: Dual biologic therapy with ustekinumab and vedolizumab is a safe and effective strategy to induce disease remission in refractory CD. Large-scale studies are necessary to validate findings in a prospective setting."

    "abstract": "Background: In the past few decades, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) became widely used antidepressants worldwide. Therefore, the adverse reactions of patients after SSRI administration became a public and clinical concern. In this study, we conducted a pharmacovigilance study using the Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database of the US Food and Drug Administration. Our main goal was to evaluate adverse events related to SSRIs, with a particular focus on abnormal weight gain and glucose/lipid metabolism disorders.\nMethod: The adverse event data for representative SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) was extracted from the FAERS database from 2004Q1 to 2023Q4. The reporting odds ratio and proportional reporting ratio were employed to explore relevant adverse event reports (ADEs) signals. Univariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to explore factors associated with glucose/lipid metabolism abnormality following SSRIs treatment.\nResults: We identified 143,744 ADE reports associated with SSRIs and revealed significant abnormal signals related to weight gain and glucose/lipid metabolism in depressed patients. Variations were observed among different SSRIs medications. Specifically, citalopram was associated with abnormal weight gain (ROR: 4, 95% CI: 3.1-5.2) and hepatic steatosis (ROR: 2.8, 95% CI: 2.1-3.6); escitalopram was correlated with gestational diabetes (ROR: 9.1, 95% CI: 6.6-12.4) and cholestasis (ROR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.75-3.38); fluoxetine was associated with obesity (ROR: 2.8, 95% CI: 2.08-3.78); fluvoxamine was linked to arteriospasm coronary (ROR: 13.87, 95% CI: 4.47-43.1); and sertraline was implicated in neonatal jaundice (ROR: 16.1, 95% CI: 12.6-20.6). Females and younger age are important risk factors for the development of associated adverse effects.\nConclusion: Our study screened for adverse effects associated with abnormal glucose/lipid metabolism, such as abnormal body weight and fatty liver, in depressed patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors by utilizing FAERS database. This provides valuable insights for healthcare professionals in accepting and managing patients treated with SSRIs."

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of the vagus nerve has been suggested as a contributing factor in various gastrointestinal disorders, prompting interest in vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) as a non-pharmacological therapy. We performed a systematic review to determine the efficacy of invasive and non-invasive VNS in gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD), functional constipation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and gastroparesis. We applied a systematic search of the literature in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases in order to identify studies comparing VNS with an adequate control condition (sham stimulation) in patients with gastrointestinal disorders. The primary outcome was adequate symptom relief. Methodological quality was evaluated using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Meta-analyses were not performed due to study heterogeneity. Seven randomized controlled trials investigating non-invasive VNS were included, with a total of 644 patients: FD (n = 426), IBD (n = 22), IBS (n = 92), and abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder (n = 104), with a mean age ranging from 15 to 65 years. Non-invasive VNS significantly improved symptoms across all subsets of patients, as measured differently according to disease type, compared with sham stimulation. Adverse events, if reported, were low, with no serious complications. Putative mechanisms of action were assumed to be related to anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects. Non-invasive VNS holds promise as a safe therapy for diverse gastrointestinal disorders. However, these findings are derived from studies with small sample sizes and provide preliminary insights. Further research is warranted to define its exact position within the therapeutic arsenal."

    "abstract": "Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is an aggressive liver malignancy that arises from second-order biliary epithelial cells. Its incidence is gradually increasing worldwide. Well-known risk factors have been described, although in many cases, they are not identifiable. Treatment options are continuously expanding, but the prognosis of iCCA remains dismal. R0 liver resection remains the only curative treatment, but only a limited number of patients can benefit from it. Frequently, major hepatectomies are needed to completely remove the tumour. This could contraindicate surgery or increase postoperative morbidity in patients with chronic liver disease and small remnant liver volume. In cases of anticipated inadequate future liver remnant, regenerative techniques may be used to expand resectability. The role and extent of lymphadenectomy in iCCA are still matters of debate. Improvements in iCCA diagnosis and better understanding of genetic profiles might lead to optimized surgical approaches and drug therapies. The role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies is broadening, gaining more and more acceptance in clinical practice. Combining surgery with locoregional therapies and novel drugs, such as checkpoint-inhibitors and molecular-targeted molecules, might improve treatment options and survival rates. Liver transplantation, after very poor initial results, is now receiving attention for the treatment of patients with unresectable very early iCCA (i.e. <2 cm) in cirrhotic livers, showing survival outcomes comparable to those of hepatocellular carcinoma. Ongoing prospective protocols are testing the efficacy of liver transplantation for patients with unresectable, advanced tumours confined to the liver, with sustained response to neoadjuvant treatment. In such a continuously changing landscape, the aim of our work is to review the state-of-the-art in the surgical and medical treatment of iCCA."

    "abstract": "Small molecules targeting activating mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are efficacious anticancer agents, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Among these, lazertinib, a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has recently gained FDA approval for use in combination with amivantamab, a dual EGFR/MET-targeting monoclonal antibody. This review delves into the discovery and development of lazertinib underscoring the improvements in medicinal chemistry properties, especially in comparison with osimertinib. Analysis of its structure-activity relationships (SAR), as outlined in the patent literature, reveals the structural diversity explored enroute to the candidate molecule. The resulting structure of lazertinib is distinguished among other TKIs due to the combination of the hydrophobic phenyl and hydrophilic amine substituents on the pyrazole. The structural basis for the selectivity against the T790M mutation is enabled by the substituted pyrazole moiety, which facilitates both van der Waals and H-bonding interactions with the EGFR kinase domain. Insights from this case study offer lessons that can inform the future design of kinase inhibitors with improved safety and efficacy profiles for cancer treatment and other diseases."

This research focused on METS-VF's potential role as a risk factor for HUA.\nMethods: Notably, 8,659 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2018 were enrolled in this study. Propensity score matching (PSM), multivariate logistic regression analysis, subgroup analysis, interaction test, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis were implemented to identify the correlation between METS-VF and HUA.\nResults: In the fully adjusted model, the results of the multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that METS-VF was related to an elevated prevalence of HUA [before PSM: odds ratio (OR) = 3.51 (2.88, 4.27), p < 0.001; after PSM: OR = 2.90 (2.36, 3.58), p < 0.001]. In RCS analysis, a non-linear positive correlation was observed between METS-VF and the incidence of HUA (before PSM: p-non-linear <0.001; after PSM: p-non-linear = 0.0065). Subgroup analysis and interaction tests revealed that the impact of METS-VF on HUA was modified by sex and ethnicity.\nConclusion: There is a significant positive correlation between METS-VF and HUA in adults in the United States. METS-VF could serve as a valuable metric for assessing the development and progression of HUA."

    "abstract": "Sulforaphane (SFN) is an isothiocyanate derived from cruciferous vegetables that has demonstrated anti-cancer, anti-microbial and anti-oxidant properties. SFN ameliorates various disease models in rodents (e.g., cancer, diabetes, seizures) that are likewise mitigated by dietary restrictions leading us to test the hypothesis that this compound elicits cellular responses consistent with being a fasting/caloric restriction mimetic. Using immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial cells, we report that SFN impacted multiple nutrient-sensing pathways consistent with a fasted state. SFN treatment (i) increased mitochondrial mass and resistance to oxidative stress, (ii) acutely suppressed markers of mTORC1/2 activity via inhibition of insulin signaling, (iii) upregulated autophagy and further amplified autophagic flux induced by rapamycin or nutrient deprivation while concomitantly promoting lysosomal biogenesis, and (iv) acutely decreased glucose uptake and lactate secretion followed by an adaptive rebound that coincided with suppressed protein levels of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) due to early transcriptional down-regulation. This early suppression of TXNIP mRNA expression could be overcome with exogenous glucosamine consistent with SFN inhibiting glutamine F6P amidotransferase, the rate limiting enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. SFN also altered levels of multiple glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates while reducing the inhibitory phosphorylation on pyruvate dehydrogenase, indicative of an adaptive cellular starvation response directing pyruvate into acetyl coenzyme A for uptake by the TCA cycle. RNA-seq of cells treated for 4 h with SFN confirmed the activation of signature starvation-responsive transcriptional programs. Collectively, these data support that the fasting-mimetic properties of SFN could underlie both the therapeutic efficacy and potential toxicity of this phytochemical."

However, epidemiological evidence linking omega-3 intake to the risk of developing osteoporosis is still emerging and remains inconclusive. This study aims to clarify the role of dietary omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention of osteoporosis.\nMethods: We analyzed data from 8,889 participants categorized into normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis groups based on their BMD scores from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We measured dietary omega-3 intake using two 24-h dietary recall interviews. Dietary omega-3 intake was quantified and divided into quartiles. Multivariate logistic regression and subgroup analysis were used to explore the correlation between dietary omega-3 intake and osteoporosis. The dose-response relationship between the two was analyzed with a restricted cubic spline (RCS).\nResults: Higher dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids was inversely associated with the risk of osteoporosis. Participants in the highest quartile of omega-3 intake had a significantly lower risk (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.53-0.93) compared to those in the lowest quartile, with a consistent trend across all adjusted models (p for trend <0.05). Subgroup analyses indicated stronger associations in individuals under 60 years of age, female and non-smokers. In individuals aged under 60, higher omega-3 intake was associated with significantly reduced osteoporosis risk (OR = 0.51, 95%CI: 0.26-0.95), females showed a protective effect of high omega-3 intake against osteoporosis (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.49-0.87). Among non-smokers, higher omega-3 intake was associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.45-0.90), whereas in smokers, the association was not evident (OR = 0.91, 95%CI: 0.55-1.52). No significant associations were found in older participants or smokers. Intake of omega-3 and osteoporosis were linearly related (p for nonlinear = 0.366).\nConclusion: This study demonstrates a significant inverse relationship between dietary omega-3 fatty acid intake and osteoporosis risk, suggesting omega-3 s play a crucial role in bone health. However, further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these findings and refine dietary recommendations for osteoporosis prevention."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) commonly results in significant postoperative pain. Adjuncts like dexamethasone (DEX) and tranexamic acid (TXA) are used to enhance postoperative recovery. This study aimed to determine whether the combined application of TXA and DEX could improve postoperative recovery during the first 24 hours in ARCR patients. Our goal is to relieve the acute postoperative pain and promote fast recovery and rapid discharge for ARCR patients.\nPatients and methods: Ninety-six patients who underwent ARCR from December 2023 to March 2024 were enrolled in this double-blinded, randomized control trial (Registration number, ChiCTR2300078507). Patients were randomized to intravenously receive 200mL of normal saline (control group), 200mL of 1g TXA in saline (TXA group), or 200 mL of 1g TXA and 5mg DEX in saline (TXA+DEX group) within 2 hours postoperatively. The primary outcome was the Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) score at 24 hours post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included mean visual analog scale (VAS) scores every four hours within 24 hours, postoperative blood test results the day after surgery, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score at 3 months postoperatively.\nResults: No significant differences in QoR-15 scores at 24 hours were observed among the groups [control, 127.0 (112.8, 138.0); TXA, 125.0 (116.5, 136.8); TXA+DEX, 132.0 (120.3, 140.8), p = 0.176]. VAS scores at 5-8 (placebo vs TXA+DEX, p = 0.014; TXA vs TXA+DEX, p = 0.002), 9-12 (placebo vs TXA+DEX, p = 0.008; TXA vs TXA+DEX, p < 0.001), and 13-16 (placebo vs TXA+DEX, p = 0.035; TXA vs TXA+DEX, p = 0.013) hours postoperatively showed a significant decrease for the TXA+DEX group compared with the control or TXA group. There were no significant differences in postoperative blood test results and ASES score at 3 months postoperatively.\nConclusion: Postoperative application of TXA alone could not facilitate postoperative recovery during the first 24 hours in ARCR patients. Although the combination of TXA and DEX presented better levels of postoperative pain between 5 and 16 hours than the control and TXA alone, it did not significantly improve postoperative recovery quality. Further large-scale and multi-center investigation is required to determine if the combined application of TXA and DEX or TXA alone is beneficial for postoperative recovery in ARCR patients."

    "abstract": "Knowledge of the natural history of CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is limited to the results of cross-sectional analysis of largely pediatric cohorts. Assessment of outcomes in adulthood is critical for clinical decision-making and future precision medicine approaches but is challenging because of the diagnostic gap and duration of follow-up that would be required for prospective studies. We aimed to delineate the natural history retrospectively from adulthood. We analyzed clinical data about an international cohort of 67 adults with CDD. We analyzed demographic, phenotypic, CDKL5 Developmental Score (CDS), and treatment data, and tested associations with genetic factors, sex, and a positive or negative history of neonatal seizures, as an early predictor of prognosis. All but one of 67 adults (55 females, median age of 24 years at last follow-up) had epilepsy, typically beginning with epileptic spasms or tonic seizures before 4 months of age. Focal-onset and non-motor seizures emerged later. Fewer than a third had been documented as having bilateral tonic-clonic seizures or status epilepticus. Seizures often improved with age, but 73% had never experienced more than 6 months of seizure-freedom. Clobazam, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine were the most frequently prescribed antiseizure medications, but no specific treatment demonstrated superiority. Common comorbidities included movement disorders, visual impairment, sleep disorders, constipation, and scoliosis. All participants had intellectual disability, 75% had not acquired speech and 45% had regressed developmentally. 16% never achieved any CDS skill, but most attained at least three, and 28% attained six or all seven. By adulthood, half of those who had achieved any CDS skill retained all their CDS skills. The skills most frequently lost were independent walking and standing. Those with a history of neonatal seizures tended to attain fewer CDS skills and were more likely to have abnormal muscle tone in adulthood, atrioventricular conduction delay, and potential complications of their illness and treatment. Individuals carrying missense variants attained more CDS skills than those with other variants and were more likely to lose skills in adulthood and develop anxiety, possibly reflecting the limited neurodevelopment of those with non-missense variants, who manifested a more multisystemic disorder. In summary, retrospective data from adulthood elucidates the evolution of symptoms, variation in developmental outcomes, and the treatment landscape in CDKL5 deficiency disorder. Presence a non-missense variants or a history of neonatal seizures indicates a more complex disorder and lower developmental trajectory. Our findings will inform management decisions, prognostication, and the design of clinical trials in CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder."

    "abstract": "Rationale: Individuals homozygous for the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) Z allele (Pi*ZZ) exhibit heterogeneity in COPD risk. COPD occurrence in non-smokers with AAT deficiency (AATD) suggests inflammatory processes may contribute to COPD risk independently of smoking. We hypothesized that inflammatory protein biomarkers in non-AATD COPD are associated with moderate-to-severe COPD in AATD individuals, after accounting for clinical factors.\nMethods: Participants from the COPDGene (Pi*MM) and AAT Genetic Modifier Study (Pi*ZZ) were included. Proteins associated with FEV 1 /FVC were identified, adjusting for confounders and familial relatedness. Lung-specific protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed. Proteins associated with AAT augmentation therapy were identified, and drug repurposing analyses performed. A protein risk score (protRS) was developed in COPDGene and validated in AAT GMS using AUC analysis. Machine learning ranked proteomic predictors, adjusting for age, sex, and smoking history.\nResults: Among 4,446 Pi*MM and 352 Pi*ZZ individuals, sixteen blood proteins were associated with airflow obstruction, fourteen of which were highly expressed in lung. PPI networks implicated regulation of immune system function, cytokine and interleukin signaling, and matrix metalloproteinases. Eleven proteins, including IL4R, were linked to augmentation therapy. Drug repurposing identified antibiotics, thyroid medications, hormone therapies, and antihistamines as potential AATD treatments. Adding protRS improved COPD prediction in AAT GMS (AUC 0.86 vs. 0.80, p = 0.0001). AGER was the top-ranked protein predictor of COPD.\nConclusions: Sixteen proteins are associated with COPD and inflammatory processes that predict airflow obstruction in AATD after accounting for age and smoking. Immune activation and inflammation are modulators of COPD risk in AATD."

    "abstract": "Co-existing neuropathological comorbidities have been repeatedly reported to be extremely common in subjects dying with dementia due to Alzheimer disease. As these are likely to be additive to cognitive impairment, and may not be affected by molecularly-specific AD therapeutics, they may cause significant inter-individual response heterogeneity amongst subjects in AD clinical trials. Furthermore, while originally noted for the oldest old, recent reports have now documented high neuropathological comorbidity prevalences in younger old AD subjects, who are more likely to be included in clinical trials. Comorbid neuropathologies in subjects with Parkinson disease have received much less attention. As with AD, comorbidities may interfere with the evaluation of PD clinical trials. We have here examined the decadal-wise presence of multiple co-pathologies, and their clinical effects, in a series of autopsies of PD and control subjects from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders. Amyloid plaques were present in more than 40% of PD patients in their 60s, and in 85% of those in their 90s. Neurofibrillary tangles were present in PD, as in all elderly humans, from the 60s onwards, while Braak tangle stages of IV or greater, which are strongly associated with severe cognitive impairment, reached 40%, 50% and 60% in those subjects in their 70s, 80s and 90s, respectively. Both plaques and tangles were significant predictors of a lower MMSE score while greater CAA scores had borderline significance. None of these, however, were independently associated with a higher UPDRS score. The ApoE4 allele, while a known predictor of AD pathology, especially amyloid plaques, was not an independent predictor of function with either of these clinical measures, suggesting that its influence is largely mediated by the neuropathologies that it predisposes to. Non-AD tauopathies, including the major conditions of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), as well as the microscopic changes of argyrophilic grains (ARG) and aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG), also co-existed with PD, especially ARG and ARTAG, which ranged between 20% and 40% across decades for the former and up to 80% for the latter; we did not find significant associations of either with final MMSE or UPDRS scores. We failed to find a significant association of limbic TDP-43 histopathology with either final MMSE score or final UPDRS motor score but our subjects were more heavily weighted with PD than those in prior studies and our cognitive correlate, limited to MMSE score, may have missed associations with cognitive domain subsets. We found several cerebrovascular pathologies to be predictors of both cognitive and motor impairment, including brain infarcts, circle of Willis atherosclerosis, and higher white matter rarefaction score. All of the investigated pathology types were common in the non-demented, non-parkinsonian control subjects, and all increased with age in parallel with those co-existing with PD, while with generally lower prevalences. The high concurrence rate of the neurodegenerative protein aggregate diseases is suggestive of either a synergistic co-pathogenesis, where one aggregate type may instigate or accelerate another type, or of one or more underlying predisposing physiological or molecular mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Elucidating the genetic contributions to Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology across diverse ancestries is a critical priority for the development of targeted therapies in a global context. We conducted the largest sequencing characterization of potentially disease-causing, protein-altering and splicing mutations in 710 cases and 11,827 controls from genetically predicted African or African admixed ancestries. We explored copy number variants (CNVs) and runs of homozygosity (ROHs) in prioritized early onset and familial cases. Our study identified rare GBA1 coding variants to be the most frequent mutations among PD patients, with a frequency of 4% in our case cohort. Out of the 18 GBA1 variants identified, ten were previously classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, four were novel, and four were reported as of uncertain clinical significance. The most common known disease-associated GBA1 variants in the Ashkenazi Jewish and European populations, p.Asn409Ser, p.Leu483Pro, p.Thr408Met, and p.Glu365Lys, were not identified among the screened PD cases of African and African admixed ancestry. Similarly, the European and Asian LRRK2 disease-causing mutational spectrum, including LRRK2 p.Gly2019Ser and p.Gly2385Arg genetic risk factors, did not appear to play a major role in PD etiology among West African-ancestry populations. However, we found three heterozygous novel missense LRRK2 variants of uncertain significance overrepresented in cases, two of which - p.Glu268Ala and p.Arg1538Cys - had a higher prevalence in the African ancestry population reference datasets. Structural variant analyses revealed the presence of PRKN CNVs with a frequency of 0.7% in African and African admixed cases, with 66% of CNVs detected being compound heterozygous or homozygous in early-onset cases, providing further insights into the genetic underpinnings in early-onset juvenile PD in these populations. Novel genetic variation overrepresented in cases versus controls among screened genes warrants further replication and functional prioritization to unravel their pathogenic potential. Here, we created the most comprehensive genetic catalog of both known and novel coding and splicing variants potentially linked to PD etiology in an underserved population. Our study has the potential to guide the development of targeted therapies in the emerging era of precision medicine. By expanding genetics research to involve underrepresented populations, we hope that future PD treatments are not only effective but also inclusive, addressing the needs of diverse ancestral groups."

Neither study administered ME/CFS-specific surveys, so available data elements were mapped onto each ME/CFS diagnostic criteria.\nResults: Of 97 JHU participants with long COVID, 5 met IOM criteria and 2 met CCC criteria. Of 281 LIINC participants with long COVID, 51 met the IOM criteria and 29 met the CCC criteria. In LIINC, participants with long COVID meeting ME/CFS criteria were more likely to be female and report a greater number of post-COVID symptoms (p<0.001).\nConclusions: The co-occurrence of ME/CFS symptoms and long COVID suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is a cause of ME/CFS. ME/CFS-specific measures should be incorporated into studies of post-acute COVID-19 to advance studies of post-SARS-CoV-2 onset ME/CFS."

    "abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is associated with increased mortality and malignancy risk, yet the determinants of clonal expansion remain poorly understood. We performed sequencing at >4,000x depth of coverage for CHIP mutations in 6,986 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative at two timepoints approximately 15 years apart. Among 3,685 mutations detected at baseline (VAF ≥ 0.5%), 50% progressed to CHIP (VAF ≥ 2%) at follow-up. We confirmed that clonal expansion is highly dependent on initial clone size and CHIP driver gene, with SF3B1 and JAK2 mutations exhibiting the fastest growth rate. We identified germline variants in TERT , IL6R , TCL1A , and MSI2 that modulate clonal expansion rate. Measured baseline leukocyte telomere length showed differential effects on incident CHIP risk, with shorter baseline leukocyte telomere length predisposing to incident PPM1D mutations and longer baseline leukocyte telomere length favoring incident DNMT3A mutations. We discovered that the IL6R missense variant p.Asp358Ala specifically impairs TET2 clonal expansion, supported by direct measurements of soluble interleukin-6 receptor and interleukin-6. Faster clonal growth rate was associated with increased risk of cytopenia, leukemia, and all-cause mortality. Notably, CHIP clonal expansion rate mediated 34.4% and 43.7% of the Clonal Hematopoiesis Risk Score's predictive value for leukemia and all-cause mortality, respectively. These findings reveal key biological determinants of CHIP progression and suggest that incorporating growth rate measurements could enhance risk stratification."

    "abstract": "Two-pore channels (TPCs) are adenine nucleotide and phosphoinositide regulated cation channels. NAADP activates and ATP blocks TPCs, while the endolysosomal phosphoinositide PI(3,5)P2 activates TPCs. TPCs are ubiquitously expressed including expression in the innate as well as the adaptive immune system. In the immune system TPCs are found, e.g. in macrophages, mast cells and T cells. In cytotoxic T cells, NAADP activates TPCs on cytolytic granules to stimulate exocytosis and killing. TPC inhibition or knockdown increases the number of regulator T cells in a transmembrane TNF/TNFR2 dependent manner, contributing to anti-inflammatory effects in a murine colitis model. TPC1 regulates exocytosis in mast cells in vivo and ex vivo, and TPC1 deficiency in mast cells augments systemic anaphylaxis in mice. In bone marrow derived macrophages NAADP regulates TPCs to control phagocytosis in a calcineurin/dynamin dependent manner, which was recently challenged by data, claiming no effect of TPCs on phagocytosis in macrophages but instead a role in phagosome resolution, a process thought to be mediated by vesiculation and tubulation. In this review we will discuss evidence and recent findings on the different roles of TPCs in immune cell function as well as evidence for adenine nucleotides being involved in these processes. Since the adenine nucleotide effects (NAADP, ATP) are mediated by auxiliary proteins, respectively, another major focus will be on the complex network of TPC regulatory proteins that have been discovered recently."

However, the field is rapidly evolving to target other antigens, such as podocalyxin (PODXL), a transmembrane protein implicated in tumor progression and poor prognosis in various cancers. This study explores the potential of PODXL-targeted CAR-T cells, utilizing a cancer-specific monoclonal antibody (CasMab) technique to enhance the specificity and safety of CAR-T cell therapy. We developed CAR-T cells based on the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from the cancer-specific monoclonal antibody PcMab-6, which selectively targets glycosylation modifications on PODXL-expressing cancer cells. As a control, CAR-T cells were also generated from PcMab-47, a non-cancer-specific antibody for PODXL. In vitro experiments demonstrated that CAR-T cells based on PcMab-6 exhibited significant antitumor activity with reduced off-target effects on normal cells compared to PcMab-47-derived CAR-T cells. Additionally, to enhance the persistence and therapeutic efficacy of these CAR-T cells, we developed a humanized version of PcMab-6 scFv. The humanized CAR-T cells showed extended antitumor effects in vivo, demonstrating the potential for prolonged therapeutic activity. These findings underscore the utility of CasMab technology in generating highly specific and safer CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors, highlighting the promise of humanized CAR-T cells for clinical application."

The relationship between AML-RAM and other CD56-positive acute leukemias is unclear. The goal of this study is to characterize the clinicopathological characteristics of AML with RAM phenotype and compare them with other CD56 co-expressing acute leukemias.\nMethods: From a multi-institutional search, we identified a total of 160 CD56+ acute leukemia cases, including AML-RAM (n = 28), CD56+ acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) (n = 11), CD56+ T-lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 39), and CD56+ AML (n = 81). We compared the clinical and pathologic findings of these groups.\nResults: AML-RAM patients were significantly younger and presented with significantly higher platelet and white blood cell counts and bone marrow (BM) blast percentages when compared to AUL (p > 0.05) and had higher median BM blast percentages than T-ALL and CD56+ AML groups (both p < 0.05). Flow cytometry showed significantly brighter expression of CD56 on blasts as compared to other CD56+ AML cases, partial CD34 expression compared to AUL, and AML, weak-to-absent CD38 expression compared to all groups, and absent HLA-DR and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase as compared to AUL and T-ALL (all p < 0.05). The frequency of abnormal karyotypes was significantly higher among RAM when compared to all groups (p < 0.05). Next-generation sequencing profiles differed among the leukemia groups, with significant enrichment of CBFA2T3::GLIS2 fusions (p < 0.05) and TP53 mutations (p < 0.05) in RAM cases compared to other AML control groups, and U2AF1 (p < 0.05), serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (p < 0.05), and BCL6 co-repressor (p < 0.05) mutations compared to AUL. Clinical outcome analysis demonstrated significantly lower 3-year overall survival of the RAM subgroup (36 months) compared to control groups (p = 0.002).\nConclusion: We find that AML with RAM phenotype occurs primarily in younger ages, with distinct clinicopathological, immunophenotypic, and mutational presentations, and worse prognosis. This diagnosis should be considered in the clinical differential diagnosis of CD56-positive acute leukemias."

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic central nervous system (CNS) disease with demyelinating inflammatory characteristics. It is the most common nontraumatic and disabling disease affecting young adults. The incidence and prevalence of MS have been increasing. However, its exact cause remains unclear. The main tests used to support the diagnosis are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Nonetheless, to date, no sensitive or specific marker has been identified for the detection of the disease at its initial stage. In recent years, researchers have focused on the fact that the number of natural killer cell group 2 member D (NKG2D) family of C-type lectin-like receptor + (NKG2D+) T cells in the peripheral blood, CSF, and brain tissue has been shown to be higher in patients with MS than in controls. The activating receptor belonging to the NKG2D is stimulated by specific ligands: in humans these are major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) and MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B (MICB) proteins and UL16 binding 1-6 proteins (ULBP1-6). Under physiological conditions, the aforementioned ligands are expressed at low or undetectable levels but can be induced in response to stress factors. NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs) are involved in epigenetic regulation of their expression. To date, studies in cell cultures, animal models, and brain tissues have revealed elevated expression of MICA/B, ULPB4, and its mouse homolog murine UL16 binding protein-like transcript (MULT1), in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes from patients with MS. Furthermore, soluble forms of NKG2DLs were elevated in the plasma and CSF of patients with MS compared to controls. In this review, we aim to describe the role of NKG2D and NKG2DLs, and their interactions in the pathogenesis of MS, as well as in other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and celiac disease (CeD). We also assess the potential of these proteins as diagnostic markers and consider future perspectives for targeting NKG2D ligands and their pathways as therapeutic targets in MS."

Four drugs-azithromycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and amoxicillin-are commonly used to treat Salmonella infections, and all four drugs were included in this review. This review found that, of these, azithromycin and ceftriaxone were more effective in treating Salmonella infections based on the patient's length of stay in the hospital and the rate at which the fever was resolved. Fluoroquinolones are also effective in treating Salmonella infection but are not approved for use in children. Azithromycin was found to be the physicians' preferred choice of medication for Salmonella infection due to its less resistance development. Almost all these drugs produce varying degrees of adverse events, but they are mild to moderate. However, azithromycin was shown to be comparatively safer than the other three drugs in terms of side effects, adverse events, and relapse associated with Salmonella treatment. Developing effective and safe therapies for all strains of Salmonella remains a priority, especially given the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant variants."

It occurs due to a gradual deficit of dopamine-producing brain cells, particularly in the substantia nigra. The precise etiology of PD is not fully understood, but it likely involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The therapies available at present alleviate symptoms but do not stop the disease's advancement. Research endeavors are currently directed at inventing disease-controlling therapies that aim at the inherent mechanisms of PD. PD biomarker breakthroughs hold enormous potential: earlier diagnosis, better monitoring, and targeted treatment based on individual response could significantly improve patient outcomes and ease the burden of this disease. PD research is an active and evolving field, focusing on understanding disease mechanisms, identifying biomarkers, developing new treatments, and improving care. In this report, we explore data from the CAS Content Collection to outline the research progress in PD. We analyze the publication landscape to offer perspective into the latest expertise advancements. Key emerging concepts are reviewed and strategies to fight disease evaluated. Pharmacological targets, genetic risk factors, as well as comorbid diseases are explored, and clinical usage of products against PD with their production pipelines and trials for drug repurposing are examined.

The novel concept of the gut-skin axis delves into how skin diseases and the microbiome interact through inflammatory mediators, metabolites, and the intestinal barrier. Elucidating the effects of the gut microbiome on skin health could provide new opportunities for developing innovative treatments for dermatological diseases. Psoriasis is a complex disease with multiple factors contributing to its development, such as diet, lifestyle, genetic predisposition, and the microbiome. This paper has a dual purpose. First, we outline the current knowledge on the unique gut microbiota patterns implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Second, and of equal importance, we briefly discuss the reciprocal impact of psoriasis treatment and gut microbiome. In addition, this review explores potential therapeutic targets based on microbial interventions, which hold promise for providing new treatment options for psoriasis."

We aim to clarify whether and how CKD and CI coexistence increases adverse health outcomes.\nMethods: This retrospective observational cohort study was conducted on CKD patients (stages 3-5) from the TriNetX platform. CKD patients with and without pre-existing CI were included from 115 healthcare organizations, and their outcomes were compared. The two cohorts were propensity score matched (PSM) for age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, BMI, blood parameters, and medications. The proportional hazard assumption was tested with a 95% confidence interval. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate survival probability. Outcomes were included from 1 day after the CKD diagnosis until 10 years afterwards.\nResults: We identified 533 772 CKD patients, and 8184 had co-existent CI. Two cohorts of 8170 PSM patients each were generated. The mean age was 60.5 ± 7.0 years and the eGFR was 52.1±19 mL/min. Mean follow-up was 23.2 months. CKD patients with CI had higher all-cause mortality (18.5% vs 12.6%), higher risk of cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs 6.9%), transient cerebral ischemic attacks (2.7% vs 1.6%), hypotension (16.5%-12.5%), malnutrition (6.7% vs 4.0%), pneumonia (10.7% vs 7.9%), urinary infections (13.2% vs 9.3%), encephalopathy (9.9% vs 5.0%), mood disorders (13.6% vs 9.7%), psychosis (9.8% vs 4.6%), and epilepsy (4.3% vs 1.5%).

It commonly originates in glial cells such as microglia, oligodendroglia, astrocytes, or subpopulations of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Glucose plays an important role in the, which energy metabolism of normal and cancer cells, but cancer cells exhibit an increased demand for glucose is required for their differentiation and proliferation. The main aim of this study is to explore the anti-cancer efficacy of the ketogenic diet against GBM. Also, this research focuses on the identification of the catalytic action of zinc in epigenetic modulators such as oxyresveratrol and ensures the combinatorial effect in the treatment of GBM.\nMethod: In this study, we have evaluated various parameters to understand the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment groups through in vivo experiments against aggressive brain tumors. Intracerebroventricular experiments were performed to induce the tumor in the animals and estimate the tumor burden and proliferative index. Followed by the Morris water maze, an open field test, and rota rod was performed to evaluate the memory and motor coordination. To understand the glucose, and ketone level modification before and after treatment, the level of glucose and ketone was analyzed. Moreover, the zinc level is assessed using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy.\nResults: The results suggested that the ketogenic diet has an anti-cancer efficacy against C6-induced GBM cell lines. Also, it exerts a synergistic effect with the epigenetic modulator, oxyresveratrol, and zinc against GBM cell lines. Moreover, the treatment groups improved memory and motor coordination and modified the glucose and ketone levels to reduce the tumor burden and Ki-67 proliferative index.\nConclusion: This study revealed the therapeutic effect of the ketogenic diet along with its combination such as oxyresveratrol and zinc against the C6-induced GBM in the Wistar rats. Also, it improved memory and motor coordination and reduced tumor growth. It also modified the glucose and ketone levels in the tumor-induced animal and supported to diminish the tumor burden."

    "abstract": "Objective: An unmet need exists for glucocorticoid-sparing treatments for patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). The antibody-drug conjugate ABBV-154 comprises adalimumab conjugated to a glucocorticoid receptor modulator. We evaluated ABBV-154 versus placebo in patients with glucocorticoid-dependent PMR.\nMethods: In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, eligible patients had confirmed PMR, glucocorticoid response and ≥2 unequivocal PMR flares while tapering glucocorticoids and still on ≥ 5 mg daily prednisone equivalent. Randomized patients received subcutaneous placebo or ABBV-154 40, 150, or 340 mg once every other week. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to flare. The sponsor voluntarily terminated the study early.\nResults: Overall, 181 patients were randomized (placebo, n = 50; ABBV-154: 40 mg, n = 42; 150 mg, n = 45; 340 mg, n = 44) and 67.4% completed study drug at week 24 Time to flare was longer for patients receiving ABBV-154 than those receiving placebo, with Kaplan-Meier estimate of 24-week flare-free rate being lower for placebo. The hazard ratios of ABBV-154 vs placebo (95% confidence interval) were 0.49 (0.27, 0.88), P = 0.017 for 40 mg; 0.44 [0.25, 0.79], P = 0.006 for 150 mg; 0.20 [0.09, 0.42], P < 0.001 for 340 mg. Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events were similar between groups, and the most common across ABBV-154 cohorts was COVID-19 (16.0%).\nConclusion: Treatment effects were observed for ABBV-154 cohorts compared with placebo for time to flare. ABBV-154 was generally well tolerated. Due to early study termination, results should be interpreted with caution.\nClinicaltrials: gov identifier: NCT04972968."

    "abstract": "Objective: We aimed to determine whether a pro-inflammatory dietary pattern (mechanism-based diet) is associated with incident female gout among two large cohorts of US women.\nMethods: We prospectively followed 79,104 women from Nurses' Health Study (NHS; 1984-2016) and 93,454 women from NHSII (1991-2017); 45,445 men from Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2016) served as a comparison cohort. Validated food frequency questionnaires were used to calculate Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern (EDIP; food-based index predictive of circulating inflammatory biomarkers) scores every 4-years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate multivariable associations between EDIP and incident, physician-diagnosed gout. We further tested whether these associations were independent of key guideline-based healthy eating patterns that previously showed beneficial associations with gout (i.e., Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH], Alternative Health Eating Index [AHEI]).\nResults: We documented 5,425 incident female gout cases over 4,372,320 person-years. EDIP was positively associated with female gout risk; hazard ratio (HR; 95% confidence interval [CI]) for the most vs. least pro-inflammatory quintile was 2.02 (1.83, 2.22). Additional adjustment for BMI attenuated this association (HR=1.71 [1.55, 1.88]). Reversing the EDIP score, women in the most anti-inflammatory EDIP quintile had largest magnitude of protective association for gout (HR=0.58 [0.53, 0.65]) compared to HRs for healthiest DASH (0.80 [0.73, 0.87]) and AHEI quintiles (0.81 [0.74, 0.89]). The magnitude of association between EDIP and male gout was substantially smaller (HR=1.24 [1.13, 1.37]; P-heterogeneity <0.0001).\nConclusion: These findings support a pivotal role of inflammation as a potential modulator between diet and gout onset, particularly among women."

    "abstract": "Background: Despite previous histopathologic evidence for its presence, the role of myocardial inflammation in the development and progression of cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) remains insufficiently understood. Thus, this study sought to characterize the prevalence and potential prognostic implications of myocardial inflammation in ATTR-CA.\nMethods: A retrospective observational study including patients with ATTR-CA diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy was conducted. Myocardial inflammation was diagnosed through a review of routine endomyocardial biopsy reports. Baseline characteristics were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Pearson χ2 test. Clinical outcomes were monitored via follow-up visits or telephone calls. Primary outcomes were all-cause death and a composite end point of all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization. Kaplan-Meier analyses, as well as univariable and age- and sex-adjusted multivariable Cox regression analyses, were used to assess differences in overall and composite end point-free survival between patients with ATTR-CA with and without myocardial inflammation.\nResults: A total of 103 patients with ATTR-CA (100 wild type; 3 variant) were enrolled. Median follow-up was 18.2 (8.0-31.1) months. Myocardial inflammation was prevalent in 32% (n=33/103) of patients with ATTR-CA. Among evaluable patients with myocardial inflammation, 96% (n=26/27) and 31% (n=9/29) had elevated CD68 (clusters of differentiation 68)-positive macrophage and CD3 (clusters of differentiation 3)-positive T-cell counts, respectively. Overall survival (P=0.017) and composite end point-free survival (P=0.014) were significantly impaired in patients with ATTR-CA with myocardial inflammation (n=33) compared with those without (n=70). Statistical significance for both associations was sustained after adjustment for age and sex, yielding adjusted hazard ratios of 4.72 (95% CI, 1.33-16.71; P=0.016) and 2.30 (95% CI, 1.04-5.11; P=0.041) for all-cause death and the composite end point, respectively.\nConclusions: Our findings affirm previous evidence that myocardial inflammation is present in approximately one-third of all patients with ATTR-CA. Moreover, we provide first data indicating that myocardial inflammation may be associated with a higher risk of death and heart failure hospitalizations in ATTR-CA."

    "abstract": "Background: Understanding the association of tobacco product use with subclinical markers is essential in evaluating health effects to inform regulatory policy. This is particularly relevant for noncigarette products (eg, cigars, pipes, and smokeless tobacco), which have been understudied because of their low prevalence in individual cohort studies.\nMethods: This cross-sectional study included 98 450 participants from the Cross-Cohort Collaboration-Tobacco data set. Associations between the use of tobacco products and subclinical markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, fibrinogen, D-dimer, coronary artery calcium, carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, and ankle-brachial index) were evaluated. The analyses used multivariable linear and logistic regression models to examine current use status for each product, with additional analyses of \"sole\" and \"exclusive\" noncigarette use (versus never use of either cigarettes or a specific noncigarette tobacco). Sole use was defined as the current use of a given noncigarette tobacco without concurrent combustible cigarette use, whereas exclusive use was defined as current noncigarette tobacco use without any history of combustible cigarette use.\nResults: A total of 20.0%, 3.0%, 0.8%, and 1.5% of participants were current cigarette, cigar, pipe, or smokeless tobacco users, respectively. Current cigarette use showed associations with higher levels of all markers compared with never cigarette use. Compared with the relevant reference group, current, sole, and exclusive cigar use was associated with 10% (95% CI, 1-20), 19% (95% CI, 12-26), and 11% (95% CI, 2-21) higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein on the geometric mean scale. Similar associations were observed for pipe and smokeless tobacco use. For interleukin-6, we observed that sole cigar use was associated with a 15% (95% CI, 6-24) higher geometric mean level, whereas current, sole, and exclusive pipe use were associated with 22% to 32% (all P values <0.05) higher levels compared with their respective reference groups. Fibrinogen levels were 2% to 6% higher (all P values <0.05) among current users of cigars, pipes, and smokeless tobacco compared with their respective reference groups. Carotid plaque and carotid intima-media thickness were also moderately associated with noncigarette tobacco use.\nConclusions: Use of noncigarette tobacco products is linked to subclinical markers relevant to cardiovascular harm. Inflammatory markers, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, have the potential for assessing early cardiovascular risk from these products and aiding regulatory authorities in evaluating their associated risks."

    "abstract": "Due to the lack of effective therapeutic approach, glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the most malignant brain tumour. By in vitro investigations on primary GBM stem cells, we highlighted one of the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance to alkylating agents, the DNA damage responses. Here, flow cytometric analysis and viability and repopulation assays were used to assess the long-term cytotoxic effect induced by the administration of a fourth-generation platinum prodrug, the (OC-6-44)-acetatodiamminedichlorido(2-(2-propynyl)octanoato) platinum(IV) named Pt(IV)Ac-POA, in comparison to the most widely used Cisplatin. The immunofluorescence studies revealed changing pathways involved in the DNA damage response mechanisms in response to the two chemotherapies, suggesting in particular the role of Poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerases in the onset of resistance to Cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. Thus, this research provides a proof of concept for how the use of a prodrug which allows the co-administration of Cisplatin and an Histone DeACetylase inhibitors, could suppress DNA repair mechanisms, suggesting a novel effective approach in GBM treatment."

    "abstract": "Background and aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence was previously characterized into four types, and patients with progression/hyper-progression recurrence (type III-IV) have an extremely poor prognosis. However, the immune background of resectable HCC, particularly in patients who experience recurrence, remains underexplored. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the immune landscape of resectable HCC, especially postoperative type III-IV recurrent HCC, and explore potential immune-targeted anti-relapse strategies for treated populations.\nMethods: The differences in gene expression in patients with recurrent HCC (type I-II (solitary or multi-intrahepatic oligo recurrence) vs. type III-IV) were investigated using bulk sequencing. Multiple immune infiltration methods (single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter and ESTIMATE) were used, and patients were divided into four groups to identify four distinct immune subtypes: immune-enrichment/matrix-poor (IE1), immune-enrichment/matrix-rich (IE2), immune intermediate/matrix-rich (ITM) and immune desert/matrix-poor (ID). Co-expression and protein interaction analyses were used to identify characteristic genes in ITM closely associated with type III-IV recurrence, which was matched with drug targets for Huaier granules (HG) and lenvatinib. Virtual docking was used to identify potential therapeutic targets, and the results were verified using single-nuclei RNA sequencing and histological analysis.\nResults: ITM was closely related to type III-IV recurrence and exhibited immunotherapy potential. The potential efficacy of inhibiting CCNA2, VEGFA, CXCL8, PLK2, TIMP1, ITGB2, ALDOA, ANXA5 and CSK in ITM reversal was determined. Molecular docking demonstrated that the proteins of these genes could bind to HG or lenvatinib. The immunohistochemical findings demonstrated differential VEGFA (p < .01) and PLK2 (p < .001) expression in ITM type and ID in type III-IV recurrent HCC.\nConclusions: Three primary immunotypes of resectable HCC (IE2, ITM and ID) were identified, and HG and lenvatinib could potentially overcome immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) resistance in ITM patients with HCC, particularly those classified as type III-IV."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Most Breast Cancer (BC) patients undergoing Radiotherapy (RT) are potentially susceptible to skin toxicity and prone to clinical symptom complaints. This study aimed to investigate the effect of oral Atorvastatin (ATV) administration on skin toxicity in BC patients undergoing RT.\nMethods: One hundred BC patients were randomly assigned to oral ATV (40 mg) or placebo tablets two days before beginning the RT until the eighth week of the RT regimen was completed. Radiation-induced dermatitis was classified according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria for eight weeks of treatment. In addition, during the eight weeks of RT, the clinical symptoms, such as pain, itching, burning, and sensitivity, were scored by patients in both groups according to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).\nResults: Ninety-four BC patients were analyzed in this study. At the end of the seventh week of RT, the between- group analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of 20.7% in the ATV group (1.693 ± 0.846) compared to the placebo group (1.900 ± 0.986, P=0.036). However, the comparison of the dermatitis grade in the ATV and placebo groups showed a reduction of 54.5% in the ATV group; this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.072). The results of VAS regarding the clinical symptoms of patients showed pain, itching, burning, and sensitivity to touch to be clinically decreased in the ATV group compared to the placebo group in the 8 weeks, but these differences were not statistically significant.\nConclusion: According to the results of this clinical study, the oral administration of ATV at a dose of 40 mg during RT regimens can effectively reduce skin RT-induced toxicity and improve the self-report clinical symptoms among BC patients."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Fungal endophytes have mutualistic associations with the plant's host, communicating through genetic and metabolic processes. As a result, they gain the ability to generate therapeutically effective metabolites and their derivatives.\nMethods: The current study aims to assess antioxidant potential along with the identification of robust metabolites within the crude extract of a potent endophytic fungus Xylaria ellisii isolated from leaf tissues of the Acorus calamus Linn plant.Four endophytic fungi were obtained from leaf tissues of Acorus calamus Linn., and identified morphologically and molecularly as distinct species. Each ethyl acetate extract of the isolated fungi exhibited a unique chemical profile in the HPTLC fingerprint at various wavelengths. The ethyl acetate (EA) extract from the fungal strain ACL-4 (Xylaria ellisii) demonstrated the strongest antioxidant activity among the four fungal endophytes examined, with an EC50 value of 292.64 ± 3.558 μg/mL. Remarkably, fungal endophyte ACL-4 extract exhibited superior antimicrobial activity at the less concentrations compared to ACL-ME extract of leaf crude.\nResults: The extract of ACL-ME-treated HEK 293T cells exhibited significant toxicity, with an IC50 value of 1481.74 ± 23.772 μg/mL, compared to fungal strain ACL-4-treated HEK 293T cells, which had an IC50 value greater than 2000 μg/mL. Consequently, the crude extract of ACL-4 and ACL-ME along with the standard drug methotrexate exhibited cytotoxic activity against cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with IC50 concentrations of 146.65 ± 0.394 μg/mL, 528.46 ± 10.912 μg/mL, and 134.11 ± 3.446 μg/mL, respectively. A total of 2,255 compounds were detected through LC-HRMS-based metabolomics in the crude metabolites of Xylaria ellisii, with certain compounds identified in multiple instances. Among this repertoire, 62 robust bioactive compounds were identified through meticulous screening, guided by existing literature. Comparative HPTLC fingerprint analysis, along with antioxidant efficacy assays of ethyl acetate extracts of Xylaria ellisii derived from Acorus calamus leaves and Cassia fistula twigs revealed the host-specific production of bioactive chemicals.\nConclusion: The top-scoring Keap1 inhibitors derived from Xylaria ellisii, including Pregabalin (-6.083 Kcal/mol), Ferulic acid (-5.434 Kcal/mol), (R)-Piperidine-2-carboxylic acid (-5.31 Kcal/mol), Genipin (-5.197 Kcal/mol), and Brivaracetam (-5.17 Kcal/mol), respectively were considered as Keap 1 inhibitors, potentially mitigate oxidative stress."

Antiseizure medications (ASM) remain a critical therapeutic intervention for treating epilepsy, notwithstanding the rapid development of other therapies. There have been substantial advances in epilepsy medications over the past three decades, with over 20 ASMs now available commercially. Here we describe the conventional and unique mechanisms of action of ASMs, focusing on everolimus, cannabidiol, cenobamate, fenfluramine, and ganaxolone, the five most recently marketed ASMs. Major obstacles in the development of ASMs are also addressed, particularly drug-resistant epilepsy as well as psychiatric and behavioral adverse effects of ASMs. Moreover, we delve into the mechanisms and comparative efficacy of ASM polytherapy, with remarks on the benefits and challenges in their application in clinical practice. In addition, the characteristics of the ideal ASM are outlined in this review. The review also discusses the development of new potential ASMs, including modifying existing ASMs to improve efficacy and tolerability. Furthermore, we expound on the modulation of γ- aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR) as a strategy for the treatment of epilepsy and the identification of a GABAAR agonist, isoguvacine, as a potential ASM."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor (GLP1R) agonists have become widespread anti-obesity/diabetes pharmaceuticals in the United States.\nAim: This article aimed to provide our current knowledge on the plausible mechanisms linked to the role of Ozempic (Semaglutide), which is generalized as one of the anti-addiction compounds.\nMethods: The effects of GLP1R agonists in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and substance use disorder (SUD) are mediated, in part, through the downregulation of dopamine signaling. We posit that while GLP1R agonism could offer therapeutic advantages in hyperdopaminergia, it may be detrimental in patients with hypodopaminergia, potentially leading to long-term induction of Suicidal Ideation (SI). The alleged posit of GLP1 agonists to induce dopamine homeostasis is incorrect. This study refined 31 genes based on the targets of Ozempic, GLP1R, and related enzymes for SI and 10 genes of the Genetic Addiction Risk Score (GARS) test. STRING-MODEL refined 29 genes, and further primary analyses indicated associations of GLP1R with DRD3, BDNF, CREB1, CRH, IL6, and DPP4.\nResults: In-depth silico enrichment analysis revealed an association between candidate genes and depressive phenotypes linked with dopaminergic signaling. Finally, through primary and in-depth silico analyses, we demonstrated multiple findings supporting that GLP1R agonists can induce depression phenotypes.\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that associated polymorphisms seem to have overlapping effects with addictive behaviors of Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) and dopamine regulation. Consequently, GLP1R agonists may represent a double-edged sword, potentially triggering both antiaddictive effects and SI by exacerbating depressive phenotypes. Thus, we encourage the scientific community to perform further empirical clinical studies to confirm this proposed pathway."

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection and the resultant COVID-19 pneumonia cause significant damage to the airway and lung epithelium. This damage manifests as mucus hypersecretion, pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which often lead to long-term complications collectively referred to as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The airway epithelium, as the first line of defence against respiratory pathogens, depends on airway basal stem cells (BSCs) for regeneration. Alterations in BSCs are associated with impaired epithelial repair and may contribute to the respiratory complications observed in PASC. Given the critical role of BSCs in maintaining epithelial integrity, understanding their alterations in COVID-19 is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the intrinsic properties of BSCs derived from COVID-19 patients and evaluates the modulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Through a combination of functional assessments and transcriptomic profiling, we identified key phenotypic and molecular deviations in COVID-19 patient-derived BSCs, including goblet cell hyperplasia, inflammation and fibrosis, which may underlie their contribution to PASC. Notably, MSC co-culture significantly mitigated these adverse effects, potentially through modulation of the interferon signalling pathway. This is the first study to isolate BSCs from COVID-19 patients in the Chinese population and establish a COVID-19 BSC-based xenograft model. Our findings reveal critical insights into the role of BSCs in epithelial repair and their inflammatory alterations in COVID-19 pathology, with potential relevance to PASC and virus-induced respiratory sequelae. Additionally, our study highlights MSC-based therapies as a promising strategy to address respiratory sequelae and persistent symptoms."

    "abstract": "Prions are assemblies of misfolded prion protein that cause several fatal and transmissible neurodegenerative diseases, with the most common phenotype in humans being sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). Aside from variation of the prion protein itself, molecular risk factors are not well understood. Prion and prion-like mechanisms are thought to underpin common neurodegenerative disorders meaning that the elucidation of mechanisms could have broad relevance. Herein we sought to further develop our understanding of the factors that confer risk of sCJD using a systematic gene prioritization and functional interpretation pipeline based on multiomic integrative analyses. We integrated the published sCJD genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics with publicly available bulk brain and brain cell type gene and protein expression datasets. We performed multiple transcriptome and proteome-wide association studies (TWAS & PWAS) and Bayesian genetic colocalization analyses between sCJD risk association signals and multiple brain molecular quantitative trait loci signals. We then applied our systematic gene prioritization pipeline on the obtained results and nominated prioritized sCJD risk genes with risk-associated molecular mechanisms in a transcriptome and proteome-wide manner. Genetic upregulation of both gene and protein expression of syntaxin-6 (STX6) in the brain was associated with sCJD risk in multiple datasets, with a risk-associated gene expression regulation specific to oligodendrocytes. Similarly, increased gene and protein expression of protein disulfide isomerase family A member 4 (PDIA4), involved in the unfolded protein response, was linked to increased disease risk, particularly in excitatory neurons. Protein expression of mesencephalic astrocyte derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), involved in protection against endoplasmic reticulum stress and sulfatide binding (linking to the enzyme in the final step of sulfatide synthesis, encoded by sCJD risk gene GAL3ST1), was identified as protective against sCJD. In total 32 genes were prioritized into two tiers based on the level of evidence and confidence for further studies. This study provides insights into the genetically-associated molecular mechanisms underlying sCJD susceptibility and prioritizes several specific hypotheses for exploration beyond the prion protein itself and beyond the previously highlighted sCJD risk loci through the newly prioritized sCJD risk genes and mechanisms. These findings highlight the importance of glial cells, sulfatides and the excitatory neuron unfolded protein response in sCJD pathogenesis."

This phase 2 trial evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of INO-4800 as a primary vaccination series in adults. We conducted a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of intradermal injection of INO-4800 in both healthy adults and elderly individuals. Eligible participants from each age group were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 3:3:2 ratio to receive two doses of INO-4800 (1.0 mg or 2.0 mg) or placebo, followed by electroporation on day 0 and day 28. The primary immunogenicity endpoints focused on determining the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of spike-binding antibodies and live SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody at day 30 after the second dose. The primary endpoint for safety was the occurrence of adverse events within 30 days after vaccination. A total of 781 volunteers were recruited and screened for eligibility, with 320 eligible young adults (≥18 to <60 years old) and 320 elderly (≥60 to ≤85 years old) were randomly assigned to receive the low-dose (1.0 mg, n = 120) or high-dose (2.0 mg, n = 120) INO-4800, or placebo (n = 80). Notably, both dose groups exhibited significant increases in spike-binding antibodies at day 30 after the second dose, with GMTs of 1609.3 (95% CI: 1385.5-1869.3) for the low-dose group and 3016.7 (95% CI: 2577.4-3530.8) for the high-dose group. Additionally, both dose groups induced neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2, with GMTs of 4.7 (95% CI: 4.2-5.3) and 6.6 (95% CI: 5.9-7.4) at day 30 after the second dose. The incidence of adverse events within 30 days after vaccination was slightly higher in the high-dose group (115 [47.9%]) than that in the low-dose group (105 [43.8%]) (p = .0060). All adverse reactions were grade 1 or 2, primarily occurring within 14 days after vaccination. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. The COVID-19 DNA vaccine INO-4800 at two doses (1.0 mg or 2.0 mg) showed an acceptable safety profile and modest immunogenicity, with the high-dose slightly more immunogenic than the low-dose.Clinical Trials Registration: www.chictr.org.cn, identifier is ChiCTR2000040146."

Furthermore, baseline sNfL concentrations, as well as cNfL levels, emerged as predictive indicators of subsequent disease progression rate (sNfL: p < 0.0001, cNfL: p = 0.0005) and overall survival (sNfL: p = 0.0073, cNfL: p = 0.0044). Employing a Cox regression model, we identified baseline sNfL level (HR = 1.01, p = 0.013), and diagnostic delay (HR = 0.94, p = 0.003) as independent prognostic factors for mortality. Furthermore, we constructed a nomogram model that incorporates both sNfL and pertinent clinical variables, which substantially enhances the accuracy of predicting disease outcomes (Concordance Index, 0.808).\nConclusion: Our study underscores the robust correlation between sNfL and cNfL in ALS patients and establishes baseline sNfL as a potent and independent prognostic marker for mortality."

    "abstract": "Aims: Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of the mitral valve (M-TEER) is known for its low complication rates. However, the optimal level and duration of post-procedural care remain unclear. This study aimed to identify the specific timeframe of post-procedural complications following M-TEER.\nMethods and results: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 865 patients who underwent M-TEER at the University Hospital Düsseldorf between August 2010 and August 2023. Our analysis focused on a comprehensive examination of all acute post-procedural complications (1-100 h), considering the time point of occurrence or diagnosis. The complication analysed included cardiogenic shock, pericardial tamponade, stroke, cardiac arrhythmias, bleeding, acute kidney injury, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular ischaemia and in-hospital mortality.\nResults: The median age was 80 (74, 84) years, and the EuroScore II was high (6.5 [4.0, 12.0] %). Functional mitral regurgitation (MR) was more common than degenerative or mixed MR (69% vs. 20%. respectively; 11%). Technical success rate was 97.2%. Overall, acute post-procedural complications occurred in 87 patients (10.1%). Most complications (75.9%) occurred within the first 4 h post-procedure. 12.6% of the complications occurred during the period between 4 and 24 h post-procedure, and 11.5% of the complications happened between 24 and 100 h post-procedure. Life-threatening complications were observed only within the first 4 h post-procedure.\nConclusions: The majority of post-procedural complications after M-TEER occur within the first 4 h, with pericardial tamponade and major bleeding occurring only during this period. These findings provide valuable insight for physicians in determining the optimal surveillance and monitoring duration after M-TEER within clinical settings."

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2-related proteins, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although these proteins are expressed in oral-related tissues, their expression patterns and modulatory mechanisms in the salivary glands remain unknown. We herein showed that full-length ACE2, which has both a fully functional enzyme catalytic site and high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-binding sites, was more highly expressed in salivary glands than in oral mucosal epithelial cells and the lungs. Regarding TMPRSS2, zymogen and the cleaved form were both expressed in the salivary glands, whereas only zymogen was expressed in murine lacrimal glands and the lungs. Metformin, an AMPK activator, increased stimulated saliva secretion and full-length ACE2 expression and decreased cleaved TMPRSS2 expression in the salivary glands, and exerted the same effects on soluble ACE2 (sACE2) and sTMPRSS2 in saliva. Moreover, metformin decreased the expression of beta-galactosidase, a senescence marker, and ADAM17, a sheddase of ACE2 to sACE2, in the salivary glands. In aged mice, the expression of ACE2 was decreased in the salivary glands, whereas that of sACE2 was increased in saliva, presumably by the up-regulated expression of ADAM17. The expression of TMPRSS2 in the salivary glands and sTMPRSS2 in saliva were both increased. Collectively, these results suggest that the protein expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the salivary glands differ from those in other oral-related cells and tissues, and also that metformin and aging affect the salivary expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which have the potential as targets for preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2."

    "abstract": "Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is a type of immunotherapy in which autologous or allogeneic immune cells, such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or engineered lymphocytes, are infused into patients with cancer to eliminate malignant cells. Recently, autologous T cells modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting CD19 showed a positive response in clinical studies for hematologic malignancies and have begun to be used in clinical practice. This article discusses the current status and promise of ACT research in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), focusing on challenges in off-the-shelf ACT using primary cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with or without genetic engineering. Early clinical trials of autologous GPC-3-, MUC1-, or CEA-targeted CAR-T cell therapies are underway for HCC. There is a growing demand for the development of off-the-shelf therapies due to the high cost and manufacturing issues associated with autologous CAR-T. The development of ACT from various cell sources, such as NK cells, NKT cells, macrophages, and γδ T cells without MHC restriction other than T cells has been proposed. Advances in genome editing, including HLA gene knockout to avoid GvHD, and strategies to enhance efficacy in overcoming the suppressive tumor microenvironment, are used to create universal 'off-the-shelf' CAR-T cells which can be used immediately as therapeutic products from healthy donors or iPSC-derived immune cells. Despite several limitations, cell-based immunotherapy is expected to become a key cancer treatment modality for both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors including HCC, thanks to technological advancements overcoming these challenges."

    "abstract": "Objectives: Cardiac biomarkers are useful for the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of myocardial injury (MI) and heart failure. By measuring specific proteins released into the bloodstream during heart stress or damage, these biomarkers help clinicians detect the presence and extent of heart injury and tailor appropriate treatment plans. This study aims to provide robust biological variation (BV) data for cardiac biomarkers in athletes, specifically focusing on those applied to detect or exclude MI, such as myoglobin, creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) and cardiac troponins (cTn), and those related to heart failure and cardiac dysfunction, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal brain natriuretic pro-peptide (NT-proBNP).\nMethods: Thirty athletes participated, providing monthly fasting blood samples over 11 months. Samples were analyzed using chemiluminescent immunoassays and statistical analyses were conducted using the classical ANOVA method, a linear mixed model and a Bayesian approach.\nResults: The study observed significant gender differences in biomarker concentrations, with higher BNP and NT-proBNP in females and higher myoglobin and CK-MB in males. Physical activity within 24 h before sampling notably affected CK-MB, myoglobin, and hs-cTnI variability. The BV estimates demonstrated high individuality for most biomarkers, suggesting their potential for personalized monitoring. The study also revealed substantial heterogeneity for NT-proBNP and BNP within the population.\nConclusions: These findings underscore the importance of considering gender-specific reference intervals and the impact of recent physical activity when interpreting cardiac biomarkers in athletes. The study delivers new BV estimates for CK-MB and myoglobin while emphasizing the need for tailored clinical assessments in athlete populations."

    "abstract": "Background: Metastatic castration resistance prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a challenging disease with a significant burden of mortality and morbidity. Most of the patients attain resistance to the available treatments, necessitating further novel therapies in this clinical setting. Actinium 225 (225Ac) prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radioligand therapy has emerged as a promising option and has been utilized for the last decade. Although a few meta-analyses were performed on the efficacy and safety of 225Ac-PSMA RLT in mCRPC patients, several current studies have been added to the literature since the latest meta-analysis. We aimed to gather all individual studies to perform up-to-date meta-analyses.\nMethods: We searched the literature using Pubmed-Medline, Web of Science, Elsevier-Sceince Direct, and Cochrane-Central databases. The data for any PSA decline, over 50% PSA decline, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity profile were captured from the studies eligible for meta-analysis. We utilized the random effect model to generate pooled estimates.\nResults: The sixteen eligible studies contained 1102 patients. Sixty-three percent of patients achieved more than 50% PSA decline, while 82% had any PSA decline after the completion of therapy. The pooled mean OS and PFS were 12.72 months (9.52-15.91) and 11.02 months (6.88-15.15), respectively. The most common adverse event was xerostomia, with a pooled proportion of 84%. Grade ≥ 3 anemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, and nephrotoxicity were encountered in 9%, 5%, 4%, and 4% of the patients.\nConclusions: 225Ac-PSMA RLT is an efficacious and safe treatment for mCRPC. Future well-designed randomized controlled studies comparing 225Ac-PSMA RLT with other approved therapeutic options would better comprehend the exact role of this therapy in the treatment sequence of mCRPC."

    "abstract": "The rising incidence of pancreatic diseases, including acute and chronic pancreatitis and various pancreatic neoplasms, poses a significant global health challenge. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) for example, has a high mortality rate due to late-stage diagnosis and its inaccessible location. Advances in imaging technologies, though improving diagnostic capabilities, still necessitate biopsy confirmation. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and deep learning, has emerged as a revolutionary force in healthcare, enhancing diagnostic precision and personalizing treatment. This narrative review explores Artificial intelligence's role in pancreatic imaging, its technological advancements, clinical applications, and associated challenges. Following the PRISMA-DTA guidelines, a comprehensive search of databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library was conducted, focusing on Artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and radiomics in pancreatic imaging. Articles involving human subjects, written in English, and published up to March 31, 2024, were included. The review process involved title and abstract screening, followed by full-text review and refinement based on relevance and novelty. Recent Artificial intelligence advancements have shown promise in detecting and diagnosing pancreatic diseases. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been effective in detecting and segmenting pancreatic tissues as well as differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. Deep learning algorithms have also been used to predict survival time, recurrence risk, and therapy response in pancreatic cancer patients. Radiomics approaches, extracting quantitative features from imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, and endoscopic ultrasound, have enhanced the accuracy of these deep learning models. Despite the potential of Artificial intelligence in pancreatic imaging, challenges such as legal and ethical considerations, algorithm transparency, and data security remain. This review underscores the transformative potential of Artificial intelligence in enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic diseases, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes and survival rates."

    "abstract": "Copper is an essential micronutrient in the human body, mainly acting as a crucial cofactor required for a wide range of physiological processes across nearly all cell types. Recent advances revealed that tumor cells seize copper to fulfill their rapid proliferation, metastasis, immune evasion, and so on by reprogramming the copper regulatory network, defined as cuproplasia. Thus, targeting copper chelation to reduce copper levels has been considered a rational tumor therapy strategy. However, overloaded copper ions could be toxic, which leads to the aggregation of lipoylated mitochondrial proteins and the depletion of iron-sulfur clusters, ultimately resulting in cell death, termed cuproptosis. Upon its discovery, cuproptosis has attracted great interest from oncologists, and targeting cuproptosis by copper ionophores exhibits as a potential anti-tumor therapy. In this review, we present the underlying mechanisms involved in cuproplasia and cuproptosis. Additionally, we sum up the chemicals targeting either cuproplasia or cuproptosis for cancer therapy. Further attention should be paid to distinguishing cancer patients who are suitable for targeting cuproplasia or cuproptosis."

    "abstract": "Background: To date, 11 DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) pathogenic variants have been declared \"hotspot\" mutations. Patients with endometrial cancer (EC) characterized by POLE hotspot mutations (POLEmut) have exceptional survival outcomes. Whereas international guidelines encourage deescalation of adjuvant treatment in early-stage POLEmut EC, data regarding safety in POLEmut patients with unfavorable characteristics are still under investigation. On the other hand, the spread of comprehensive genome profiling programs has underscored the need to interpret POLE variants not considered to be hotspots.\nMethods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of 596 sequenced patients with EC. The genomic landscape of POLEmut EC was compared with cases harboring nonhotspot POLE mutations within the exonuclease domain. Additionally, the genomic characteristics of multiple classifiers, as well as those exhibiting unfavorable histopathological and clinical features, were examined.\nResults: No significant genomic differences were observed among patients with POLEmut EC when comparing multiple classifiers to not-multiple classifiers or those with unfavorable clinical features. However, the tumor mutational burden differed in both comparisons, whereas the percentage of C>G mutations only differed in the comparison based on clinical features. Specific POLE mutations, even if not considered to be hotspots, have genomic features comparable to POLEmut.\nConclusions: The present findings confirm the absence of significant genomic differences among POLEmut patients regardless of multiple-classifier status or association with high-risk clinical features. Prognostic data will be essential to elucidate the clinical significance of POLE mutations not classified as hotspots that exhibit genomic characteristics similar to those in POLEmut patients."

Both mWSD and pwWSD increased serum BA concentrations. Notably, mWSD-exposed juvenile offspring had increased periportal CK19 expression and cholangiocyte gene expression supporting proliferation compared with maternal chow-exposed offspring. Fetuses exposed to mWSD had increased CK19 expression and hepatic BAs which correlated positively with periportal collagen deposition and negatively with markers of fetal oxygenation. In juvenile offspring, increased serum BAs correlated positively with hepatic oxidative stress and portal fibrosis without elevated liver enzymes.\nConclusions: mWSD is associated with hallmarks of paediatric MASLD including portal bile ductular reaction, portal fibrosis and dysregulated BA homeostasis. These conditions begin in utero and persist in juvenile offspring regardless of their postweaning diet. These findings implicate changes in BA metabolism that may drive developmental programming of MASLD in juvenile offspring beginning in utero."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have improved the therapeutic arsenal in outpatient oncology care; however, data on necessity of hospitalizations associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are scarce. Here, we characterized hospitalizations of patients undergoing ICI, from the prospective cohort study of the immune cooperative oncology group (ICOG) Hannover.\nMethods: Between 12/2019 and 06/2022, 237 patients were included. Clinical data and characteristics of ICI were collected during a 6-month observation period after the initiation of therapy. Descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier statistics were administered.\nResults: During the observation period, 30/237 patients were hospitalized (HA(+)). Most common underlying tumor entities were malignant melanoma (59.5%), renal cell carcinoma (13.1%), and nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma (12.7%). HA(+) patients exhibited an increased rate of pulmonary and cerebral metastases. We observed a significantly higher hospitalization rate during dual ICI with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab (p = 0.001). The predominant irAEs for hospitalization were colitis (26.7%), followed by hypophysitis (13.3%), leading to a median hospitalization of 7 (1-34) days. Interdisciplinary consultations were frequent, especially to gastroenterology (46.7%) and neurology (26.7%). Although a trend toward a prolonged overall survival in the HA(+) subgroup was identified, no statistically significant differences were found.\nDiscussion: The hospitalization rate of 12.6% is comparable to rates reported in previous studies. There was a disproportionate admission of patients with immune-related colitis and hypophysitis compared to the prevalence described under ICI. We observed a high need for interdisciplinary consultations in line with the heterogeneity of immune-mediated side effects. Compared to non-hospitalized patients, there was no survival disadvantage in the HA(+) cohort.\nConclusion: With a relatively low hospitalization rate, short length of stay, and good clinical outcome, our data support the outpatient nature of ICI. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and vigilant monitoring of irAEs to ensure timely recognition and management."

When intracellular AAV2 and extracellular AAV9 were produced in HEK293T cells using the triple transfection method, apoptosis occurred during the AAV production. To mitigate apoptosis induced by AAV production, the pro-apoptotic BAX/BAK1 genes were knocked out in HEK293T cells. BAX/BAK1 knockout (BBKO) in HEK293T cells significantly increased the production of both AAV2 and AAV9. For AAV2, BBKO increased the genome titer of AAV2 by 55% without negatively affecting the proportion of unwanted empty capsids generated during AAV production. Empty capsid ratios were determined based on viral genome and capsid titers and confirmed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Likewise, for AAV9, BBKO increased the genome titer of AAV9 by 66% without negatively affecting the proportion of empty capsids. Additionally, as assessed using a transduction assay, BBKO increased the functional titers of AAV2 and AAV9 by 30% and 46%, respectively. Therefore, BBKO increased AAV production, while maintaining full capsid ratio and infectivity. Taken together, BBKO proved to be an efficient method for enhancing AAV production in HEK293T cells for both AAV2 and AAV9."

We focus on uncovering how RIPK3 contributes to ovarian GC senescence. Primary GCs were treated with H₂O₂ to induce senescence. ROS was detected via DCFH-DA staining. Levels of senescence-related molecules and SA-β-Gal activity were examined. Cyclophosphamide was administered to mice to induce POF. The impact of RIPK3 on atretic follicles and sex hormones was evaluated through HE staining and ELISA, respectively. The acRIP-qPCR analysis of RIPK3 ac4C levels, RIP detection for interaction between RIPK3 and NAT10, and actinomycin D treatment to detect RIPK3 degradation were conducted. In H2O2-treated GCs and POF mouse ovaries, levels of RIPK3, ROS, senescence-related molecules, as well as SA-β-Gal activity, were all up-regulated, and this effect was suppressed by RIPK3 inhibition. RIPK3 interference reduced atretic follicles and FSH levels while increasing AMH and E2 levels. Nrf2 and HO-1 content were diminished in the models, whereas si-RIPK3 facilitated their expression. The effect of si-RIPK3 on decreased levels of ROS and senescence-related molecules was reversed by ML385. H2O2 decreased RIPK3 mRNA degradation and increased its ac4C modification. The ac4C modifying enzyme NAT10 was up-regulated in the models, and NAT10 enhanced RIPK3 mRNA stability through ac4C modification. NAT10 knockdown mitigated ovarian GC senescence by inhibiting RIPK3 expression. The promotion of RIPK3 mRNA stability through ac4C modification by NAT10, in turn, affects the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and promotes ovarian GC senescence."

We systematically evaluated whether the performance of three NITs in detecting advanced fibrosis in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) varies with age, sex, body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) status or liver enzymes.\nMethods: Data from 586 adult LITMUS Metacohort participants with histologically characterised MASLD were included. The diagnostic performance of the Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4), enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) and vibration-controlled transient elastography liver stiffness measurement (VCTE LSM) was evaluated. Performance was expressed as the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). Thresholds for detecting advanced fibrosis (≥F3) were calculated for each NIT for fixed (high) sensitivity, specificity and predictive values.\nResults: Differences in AUC between all subgroups were small and statistically not significant, indicating comparable performance in detecting ≥F3, irrespective of these clinical factors. However, different thresholds were needed to achieve the same level of accuracy with each test. For example, for a fixed sensitivity and specificity, the thresholds for all three NITs were higher in patients with T2DM. Effects for sex, age and liver enzymes were less pronounced.\nConclusions: Performance of the selected NITs in detecting advanced liver fibrosis does not vary substantially with clinical characteristics. However, different thresholds have to be selected to achieve the same sensitivity, specificity and predictive values in the respective subgroups. Large prospective studies are called for to study NIT accuracy considering multiple patient characteristics."

We aimed to investigate the relationship between basal forebrain and hippocampus atrophy, cognitive decline, and neuropathology in a large autopsy sample.\nMethods: Data were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). Basal forebrain and hippocampus volumes were extracted using an established automated MRI volumetry approach. Associations of regional volumes with pathological markers (Braak stage, CERAD score, and McKeith criteria for LB pathology) and cognitive performance were assessed using Bayesian statistical methods.\nResults: We included people with autopsy-confirmed pure AD (N = 248), pure LBD (N = 22), and mixed AD/LBD (N = 185). Posterior basal forebrain atrophy was most severe in mixed AD/LB pathology compared to pure AD (Bayes factor against the null hypothesis BF10 = 16.2) or pure LBD (BF10 = 4.5). In contrast, hippocampal atrophy was primarily associated with AD pathology, independent of LB pathology (pure AD vs. pure LBD: BF10 = 166, pure AD vs. mixed AD/LBD: BF10 = 0.11, pure LBD vs. mixed AD/LBD: BF10 = 350). Cognitive performance was more impaired in AD pathology groups, with Braak stage being the strongest predictor. Hippocampal volume partially mediated this relationship between tau pathology and cognitive impairment, while basal forebrain volume had a limited role in mediating the relationship between pathological burden and cognitive outcomes.\nConclusion: In a heterogeneous autopsy sample, AD and LB pathology both contribute to cholinergic basal forebrain degeneration whereas hippocampus atrophy is more specifically related to AD pathology. Cognitive deficits are primarily associated with tau pathology which is partly mediated by hippocampus, but not basal forebrain atrophy."

This study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors, including immunosuppression, for different manifestations of VZV-associated CNS infection. Patient registers were used to include adults diagnosed with VZV-associated CNS infections between 2010 and 2019 in Sweden. Nationwide registers covering specialized care, and regional registers covering primary care, were used. Controls without a VZV diagnosis during the study period were matched by age and sex. Risk factors were calculated using multivariable logistic regression. A total of 1488 adult cases with VZV-associated CNS infection were identified, yielding an incidence of 1.92/100 000 person-years, which increased over the study period. Meningitis was the most frequent (45%), followed by encephalitis (38%), and Ramsay Hunt syndrome (17%). The highest incidence was observed in individuals over 70 years of age (4.15/100 000 person-years), in whom encephalitis was most common. Statistically significant risk factors for VZV-associated CNS infection were HIV, hematological cancer, treatment with specific immunosuppressants or glucocorticoids, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, solid cancer, stroke, and congestive heart failure. Encephalitis was associated with older age, more immunosuppressive conditions, and more comorbidities than other manifestations. In conclusion, VZV is a common cause of adult viral CNS infection, for which elderly individuals with immunosuppressive or comorbid conditions are at the highest risk. The strongest risk factors found were HIV, hematological cancer, and treatment with specific immunosuppressants or high-dose glucocorticoids."

    "abstract": "Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide, leading to cognitive and functional decline. Early detection and intervention are crucial for enhancing the quality of life of patients and their families. Remote Monitoring Technologies (RMTs) offer a promising solution for early detection by tracking changes in behavioral and cognitive functions, such as memory, language, and problem-solving skills. Timely detection of these symptoms can facilitate early intervention, potentially slowing disease progression and enabling appropriate treatment and care.\nMethods: The RADAR-AD study was designed to evaluate the accuracy and validity of multiple RMTs in detecting functional decline across various stages of AD in a real-world setting, compared to standard clinical rating scales. Our approach involved a univariate analysis using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) to analyze individual features of six RMTs while adjusting for variables such as age, sex, years of education, clinical site, BMI and season. Additionally, we employed four machine learning classifiers - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost - using a nested cross-validation approach to assess the discriminatory capabilities of the RMTs.\nResults: The ANCOVA results indicated significant differences between healthy and AD subjects regarding reduced physical activity, less REM sleep, altered gait patterns, and decreased cognitive functioning. The machine-learning-based analysis demonstrated that RMT-based models could identify subjects in the prodromal stage with an Area Under the ROC Curve of 73.0 %. In addition, our findings show that the Amsterdam iADL questionnaire has high discriminatory abilities.\nConclusions: RMTs show promise in AD detection already in the prodromal stage. Using them could allow for earlier detection and intervention, thereby improving patients' quality of life. Furthermore, the Amsterdam iADL questionnaire holds high potential when employed remotely."

    "abstract": "Background: Bone-invasive Pituitary Neuroendocrine Tumors (BI PitNETs) epitomize an aggressive subtype of pituitary tumors characterized by bone invasion, culminating in extensive skull base bone destruction and fragmentation. This infiltration poses a significant surgical risk due to potential damage to vital nerves and arteries. However, the mechanisms underlying bone invasion caused by PitNETs remain elusive, and effective interventions for PitNET-induced bone invasion are lacking in clinical practice.\nMethods: In this study, we performed single-cell (n = 87,287) RNA sequencing on 10 cases of bone-invasive PitNETs and 5 cases of non-bone-invasion PitNETs (Non-BI PitNETs). We identified various cell types and determined their interactions through cell-cell communication analysis, which was further validated experimentally.\nResults: We identified a novel TNF-α+ TAM macrophage subset. BI PitNETs showed increased IL-34 secretion, impacting TNF-α+ TAMs via the IL34/CSF1R axis, leading to TNF-α production. TNF-α+ TAMs, in turn, communicate with CD14+ monocytes to promote their differentiation into osteoclasts and leading to bone invasion. In addition, we defined a gene signature for TNF-α+ TAM to guide the clinical prognosis prediction of BI PitNETs.\nConclusions: Our study elucidates the tumor microenvironment changes in bone invasion and identifies the critical role of TNF-α+ TAMs in promoting bone invasion of PitNETs, laying a foundation for developing new molecular markers or therapeutic agents targeting BI PitNETs."

    "abstract": "Polymyxins are last-resort antimicrobial peptides administered clinically against multi-drug resistant bacteria, specifically in the case of Gram-negative species. However, an increasing number of these pathogens employ a defense strategy that involves a relay of enzymes encoded by the pmrE (ugd) loci and the arnBCDTEF operon. The pathway modifies the lipid-A component of the outer membrane (OM) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by adding a 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (L-Ara4N) headgroup, which renders polymyxins ineffective. Here, we report the cryo-EM SPR structures of glycosyltransferase ArnC from Salmonella typhimurium determined in apo and UDP-bound forms at resolutions 2.75 Å and 3.8 Å, respectively. The structure of the ArnC protomer comprises three distinct regions: an N-terminal glycosyltransferase domain, transmembrane region, and the interface helices (IHs). ArnC forms a tetramer with C2 symmetry, where the C-terminal strand inserts into the adjacent protomer. This tetrameric state is further stabilized by two distinct interfaces formed by ArnC that form a network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. The binding of UDP induces conformational changes that stabilize the loop between residues H201 to S213, and part of the putative catalytic pocket formed by IH1 and IH2. The surface property analysis revealed a hydrophobic cavity formed by TM1 and TM2 in the apo state, which is disrupted upon UDP binding. The comparison of ArnC structures to their homologs GtrB and DPMS suggests the key residues involved in ArnC catalytic activity."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Effects of Dapagliflozin (Dapa) and Dapagliflozin-Saxagliptin combination (Combo) was examined on peripheral blood derived CD34 + Hematopoetic Stem Cells (HSCs) as a cellular CVD biomarker. Both Dapa (a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 or SGLT2, receptor inhibitor) and Saxagliptin (a Di-peptydl-peptidase-4 or DPP4 enzyme inhibitor) are commonly used type 2 diabetes mellitus or T2DM medications, however the benefit of using the combination has not been evaluated for cardio-renal risk assessment, in a real-life practice setting, compared to a placebo.\nHypothesis: We hypothesized that Dapa will improve the outcomes when compared to placebo and the Combo maybe even more beneficial.\nMethods: This is a pilot study evaluating low dose Dapagliflozin 10 mg or low dose Dapa + low dose Saxagliptin combination. 15 subjects were enrolled in 16 weeks, double-blind, three-arm, randomized placebo matched trial, with 10mg Dapa + Saxa placebo (n = 4), 10 mg Dapa + 5 mg Saxa (n = 5) Combo, And Dapa placebo + Saxa placebo (n = 6), Placebo groups. T2DM subjects (age 30-70 yrs) with HbA1c of 7-10%, were included. CD34 + HSC number, migration, mRNA expression along with biochemistry and urine exosomes were measured. Data were collected at week 0, 8, and 16. For statistics, a mixed model regression analysis was used.\nResults: Significant HbA1c (p = 0.0357) reduction was noted in Combo group versus Dapa alone and Placebo. hsCRP levels (P = 0.0317) and IL-6, two important inflammatory molecules, were significantly reduced in both Dapa and Combo vs. Placebo. Leptin levels decreased significantly in both Dapa alone (p = 0.035) and Combo group(p = 0.015), vs. Placebo, however the Adiponectin levels were higher in Dapa alone group. Dapagliflozin alone reduced lipid parameters significantly particularly triglyceride (TG) when compared to placebo, with resultant visit 3 values at 99.5 ± 7.2 vs. 129 ± 12.3 and LDL/HDL ratio values were similar at 2.18 ± 0.08 vs. 2.13 ± 0.15. CD34 + cell migration improved significantly in both Dapa alone (p = 0.05) and Combo group (p = 0.05) vs. Placebo.\nConclusions: Several parameters showed significant improvement with both Dapa alone and Combo compared to placebo. However, when all outcome measures were taken into account, other than glycemic control the Combo didn't seem to offer any further benefit, over Dapa alone. Therefore, contrary to our initial hypothesis we do not believe the more expensive Dapa + Saxa combination offers any specific cardiovascular benefit compared to Dapagliflozin alone. However it is noteworthy that both Dapa and its combination with Saxagliptin showed significant improvement compared to placebo in T2DM, particularly when progenitor cell based numbers and function were analyzed and taken into account.\nTrial registration: The trial was registered with Clinical Trials.gov number NCT03660683, last updated 06052023."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Glucose starvation induces the accumulation of disulfides and F-actin collapse in cells with high expression of SLC7A11, a phenomenon termed disulfidptosis. This study aimed to confirm the existence of disulfidptosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and elucidate the role of Cancer Susceptibility 8 (CASC8) in this process.\nMethods: The existence of disulfidptosis in PDAC was assessed using flow cytometry and F-actin staining. CASC8 expression and its clinical correlations were analyzed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and further verified by chromogenic in situ hybridization assay in PDAC tissues. Cells with CASC8 knockdown and overexpression were subjected to cell viability, EdU, transwell assays, and used to establish subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor models. Disulfidptosis was detected by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assays. RNA sequencing and metabolomics analysis were performed to determine the metabolic pathways which were significantly affected after CASC8 knockdown. We detected the glucose consumption and the NADP+/NADPH ratio to investigate alterations in metabolic profiles. RNA immunoprecipitation combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization assay was used to identify protein-RNA interactions. Protein stability, western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed to reveal potential molecular mechanism.\nResults: Disulfidptosis was observed in PDAC and could be significantly rescued by disulfidptosis inhibitors. CASC8 expression was higher in PDAC samples compared to normal pancreatic tissue. High CASC8 expression correlated with a poor prognosis for patients with PDAC and contributed to cancer progression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, CASC8 was associated with disulfidptosis resistance under glucose starvation conditions in PDAC. Mechanistically, CASC8 interacted with c-Myc to enhance the stability of c-Myc protein, leading to the activation of the pentose phosphate pathway, a reduction of the NADP+/NADPH ratio and ultimately inhibiting disulfidptosis under glucose starvation conditions.\nConclusions: This study provides evidence for the existence of disulfidptosis in PDAC and reveals the upregulation of CASC8 in this malignancy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CASC8 acts as a crucial regulator of the pentose phosphate pathway and disulfidptosis, thereby promoting PDAC progression."

    "abstract": "Background: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a heterogeneous disease composed of different endotypes. It is important to develop useful biomarkers for endotyping UC; however, available biomarkers are insufficient. We have already established that periostin is a surrogate biomarker of type 2 inflammation. In this study, we examined the usefulness of periostin as a biomarker of UC and the role of periostin in its pathogenesis.\nMethods: We examined periostin expression in the colons of UC patients. We next investigated serum periostin in UC patients and its correlation with eosinophilic infiltration in their colons. We then examined whether serum periostin could predict the efficacy of oral prednisolone. Finally, we investigated the role of periostin in UC pathogenesis by creating its genetic deficiency using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mice.\nResults: Periostin expression and serum periostin were significantly high in UC patients compared to healthy controls; however, both were diverse, showing heterogeneity of the underlying mechanism of UC. Both serum periostin and tissue periostin expression, but not blood eosinophils, were significantly associated with eosinophil infiltration. Type 2-dominant UC patients as defined by serum periostin showed significantly higher clinical remission rates for the treatment with oral prednisolone. Genetic deficiency in periostin improved colonic inflammation in a DSS-treated mouse model.\nConclusions: Periostin can be a useful biomarker to stratify type 2-dominant UC patients, thereby predicting the efficacy of oral prednisolone. Moreover, periostin plays an important role in the setting of type 2-dominant UC."

This study aimed to assess whether the effect at 12 months persisted at 24 months.\nMethods: Fifty-four schools were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. All participants (594 children in grade 3 and 1188 of their adult family members) who completed the baseline survey were contacted again 12 months after the trial. The primary outcome was the difference in salt intake change between the intervention and control groups at 24 months versus baseline and 12 months, measured by the mean two consecutive 24-h urinary sodium excretions. The secondary outcome was the difference in the change of blood pressure and salt-related Knowledge, Attitude, Practice (KAP) score.\nResults: The difference in salt intake change in adults between the intervention and control groups after adjusting for confounding factors was - 0.38 g/day at 24 months versus baseline (95% CI - 0.81 to 0.05, p = 0.09), following the - 0.83 g/day (95% CI - 1.25 to - 0.41, p < 0.001) at 12 months. The adjusted difference in SBP change was - 2.19 mm Hg (95% CI - 3.63 to - 0.76, p = 0.003) at 24 months versus baseline, following the - 1.80 mm Hg (95% CI - 3.19 to - 0.40, p = 0.01) at 12 months. The intervention group had a higher KAP score than the control group both at 12 months and at 24 months versus baseline. No significant changes were found in children.\nConclusions: The effect of the education program on adults' salt intake faded, but the SBP lowering effect and the improvement of KAP score remained 12 months after the completion of the RCT. Continuous efforts are needed to maintain the salt reduction effects in real-world settings.\nTrial registration: ChiCTR1800017553. Registered on August 3, 2018."

Monoclonal antibodies (MABs) serve as a promising therapeutic approach for AD by selectively targeting key pathogenic factors, such as amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, tau protein, and neuroinflammation. Specifically, based on their efficacy in removing Aβ plaques from the brains of patients with AD, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved three anti-amyloid MABs, aducanumab (Aduhelm®), lecanemab (Leqembi®), and donanemab (Kisunla™). Notably, lecanemab received traditional approval after demonstrating clinical benefit, supporting the Aβ cascade hypothesis. These MABs targeting Aβ are categorized based on their affinity to diverse conformational features of Aβ, including monomer, fibril, protofibril, and plaque forms of Aβ as well as pyroglutamate Aβ. First-generation MABs targeting the non-toxic monomeric Aβ, such as solanezumab, bapineuzumab, and crenezumab, failed to demonstrate clinical benefit for AD in clinical trials. In contrast, second-generation MABs, including aducanumab, lecanemab, donanemab, and gantenerumab directed against pathogenic Aβ species and aggregates have shown that reducing Aβ deposition can be an effective strategy to slow cognitive impairment in AD. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current status, mechanisms, outcomes, and limitations of second-generation MABs for the clinical treatment of AD. Moreover, we discuss the perspectives and future directions of anti-amyloid MABs in the treatment of AD."

Understanding how immunotherapies lead to severe COVID-19 is crucial for improving patient outcomes.\nMethods: Human protein microarrays were used to examine the expression of 440 protein molecules in MM patients treated with bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTe) (n = 9), anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (n = 10), and proteasome inhibitor (PI)-based regimens (n = 10). Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified and analyzed using bioinformatics.\nResults: BiTe therapy was associated with a higher incidence of severe COVID-19. We identified 21 and 29 DEPs between BiTe and anti-CD38 mAbs group, and BiTe and PI-based group, respectively, along with 25 DEPs between the anti-CD38 and PI groups. Principal component analysis and clustering showed distinct protein expression profiles between the BiTe and PI groups. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that DEPs between the BiTe and PI groups were related to cytokine activity and leukocyte migration. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that these DEPs were enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is the most correlated with other DEPs and thus may play a key role in both enriched pathways, and the level of LIF protein was highest in the BiTe group.\nConclusions: BiTe therapy is linked to a higher risk of severe COVID-19 due to an inflammatory cytokine storm, with LIF and the JAK-STAT pathway playing key roles. Targeting LIF and JAK-STAT pathway may help reduce severe COVID-19 in MM patients treated with BiTe."

Additionally, large-scale Mendelian randomization analyses were performed using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data on OSA and 3935 brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs), assessed in up to 33,224 individuals between December 2023 and March 2024, to explore potential genetic causality between OSA and alterations in whole brain structure and function.\nResults: In the cohort study, OSA patients exhibited significantly lower fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and regional homogeneity in the right posterior cerebellar lobe and bilateral superior and middle frontal gyrus, while showing higher levels in the left occipital lobe and left posterior central gyrus. Decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) but increased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was shown in the bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus.

    "abstract": "Efferocytosis is a mechanism by which phagocytes efficiently clear apoptotic cells, averting their secondary necrosis and the subsequent release of potentially immunogenic or cytotoxic substances that can trigger strong immune and inflammatory responses. During efferocytosis, the metabolic pathways of phagocytes are transformed, which, along with the catabolism of apoptotic cargo, can affect their function and inflammatory state. Extensive apoptosis occurs during placental development, and some studies reported the immunomodulatory effects of efferocytosis at the maternal-fetal interface. The dysregulation of efferocytosis is strongly linked to pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and recurrent spontaneous abortion. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of efferocytosis and its relationships with metabolism and inflammation. We also highlight the roles of professional and non-professional phagocytes in efferocytosis at the maternal-fetal interface and their impact on pregnancy outcomes and explore relevant regulatory factors. These insights are expected to guide future basic research and clinical strategies for identifying efferocytosis-related molecules as potential predictors or therapeutic targets in obstetric diseases."

The analysis included 406,584 participants from the UK Biobank cohort (54.1% women; age range: 38-73 years), with sleep duration classified as short (≤ 6 h, 24.2%), normal (7-8 h, 68.4%), and long (≥ 9 h, 7.4%). Healthy eating habits were defined as a daily intake of at least 25 g of fibre, seven portions of fruits and vegetables, and fewer than four servings of meat per week. These dietary factors were combined into a score ranging from 0 (least healthy) to 3 (healthiest). Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted, with a median follow-up period of 12.6 years, ending on September 30, 2021.\nResults: 3949 participants died from cancer of the digestive system. Both short and long sleep duration were associated with an increased risk of mortality from cancer of the digestive system (1.09 (1.01-1.18) and 1.14 (1.03-1.27), respectively). Additionally, a diet score ≥ 1 was linked to a lower cancer risk (0.72-0.91 (0.59-0.96)). Adjusting for smoking, type 2 diabetes, and body mass index (BMI) status eliminated the association between sleep duration and digestive cancer mortality. The association between healthy dietary patterns and the risk of digestive system cancer mortality did not vary by sleep duration.\nConclusions: Aberrant sleep durations may increase the risk of mortality from digestive system cancer, potentially through smoking, higher BMI, and type 2 diabetes. However, aberrant sleep durations do not seem to reduce the protective effects of a healthy dietary pattern."

    "abstract": "Vacuolization of hematopoietic precursors cells is a common future of several otherwise non-related clinical settings such as VEXAS, Chediak-Higashi syndrome and Danon disease. Although these disorders have a priori nothing to do with one other from a clinical point of view, all share abnormal vacuolization in different cell types including cells of the erythroid/myeloid lineage that is likely the consequence of moderate to drastic dysfunctions in the ubiquitin proteasome system and/or the endo-lysosomal pathway. Indeed, the genes affected in these three diseases UBA1, LYST or LAMP2 are known to be direct or indirect regulators of lysosome trafficking and function and/or of different modes of autophagy. Furthermore, all three genes are highly expressed in the more mature myeloid cells pointing out their likely important function in these cells. LAMP2 deficiency for instance is known to be associated with alterations of lysosome architecture and function. It is thus well established that different cell types from Danon disease patients that harbor invalidating mutations in LAMP2 exhibit giant lysosomes containing undigested materials characteristic of defects in the fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes, a feature also found in VEXAS and CHS. Other similarities regarding these three diseases include granulocyte and monocyte dysfunctions and a recurrent inflammatory climate. In the present review we discuss the possibility that some common clinical manifestations of these diseases, notably the hematopoietic ones are consecutive to a dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathway in myeloid/erythroid progenitors and in mature myeloid cells including neutrophiles, monocytes and macrophages. Finally, we propose reacidification as a way of reinducing lysosome functionalities and autophagy as a potential approach for a better management of these diseases."

Patients with multiple myeloma who relapse after initial high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cells have a median progression free survival up to 2-3 years, depending on risk factors such as previous remission duration. In recent years, growing evidence has suggested that allogeneic stem cell transplantation could be a promising treatment option for patients with relapsed or progressed multiple myeloma. However, prospective randomized trials including allogeneic stem cell transplantation as second-line therapy do not exist to date and therefore urgently needed to demonstrate the value of this therapy in the overall setting of patients with multiple myeloma.\nMethods: This clinical trial is a national, multicenter, randomized, open labeled phase III study conducted in 30 hospitals spread all over Germany. After study inclusion, all patients will receive 3 cycles of salvage therapy with one of the currently approved triplet regimens for first relapse. After 3 cycles of salvage therapy, remission status will be assessed. If the patient achieves at least stable disease, partial or complete remission and an HLA compatible stem cell donor could be identified, he/she will be randomized (1:1) to the control or interventional study arm. Approximately 400 patients will be enrolled to enable a randomization of 280 patients. The primary endpoint is overall survival at five years after randomization. The main secondary objectives and endpoints are progression-free survival rate, time-to first occurrence of an infection with CTCAE grade 3-5, non-relapse mortality rate and incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.\nDiscussion: The present clinical study is designed to evaluate the superiority of allogeneic stem cell transplantation compared to conventional therapy (triplet chemotherapy) for the difference in overall survival at 5 years, toxicity and quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma who have relapsed or progressed after first-line autologous stem cell therapy.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05675319) registered on January 9, 2023."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders characterized by defective heparan sulfate (HS) degradation, such as Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA-D (MPS-IIIA-D), result in neurodegeneration and dementia in children. However, dementia is preceded by severe autistic-like behaviours (ALBs), presenting as hyperactivity, stereotypies, social interaction deficits, and sleep disturbances. The absence of experimental studies on ALBs' mechanisms in MPS-III has led clinicians to adopt symptomatic treatments, such as antipsychotics, which are used for non-genetic neuropsychiatric disorders. However, they have limited efficacy in MPS-III and lead to higher extrapyramidal effects, leaving ALBs in MPS-IIIA as an unmet medical need with a significant burden on patients and their families. Using mouse and cellular models of MPS-IIIA, we have previously shown that ALBs result from increased proliferation of mesencephalic dopamine neurons during embryogenesis. In adulthood, MPS-IIIA mice exhibit an imbalance of dopaminergic receptor subtypes, resulting in striatal overstimulation of the D1 dopamine receptor (D1R)-direct pathway, contrasting with a downregulation of the D2 dopamine receptor (D2R)-indirect pathway. In this study, we aimed to provide an evidence-based pharmacological approach for managing ALBs in MPS-IIIA. We hypothesized that rebalancing dopaminergic receptor signalling with a D1R antagonist, rather than a D2 antagonist, would lead to safe and effective treatment. Neither risperidone nor methylphenidate improves ALBs in the MPS-IIIA mouse model, with the former showing increased cataleptic (extrapyramidal-like) side effects compared to littermate wild-type animals. Methylphenidate, however, showed some beneficial effects on neuroinflammation and later manifesting dementia-like behaviours. In contrast, ecopipam, a D1 antagonist already used in the clinic for other neuropsychiatric disorders, rescues ALBs, cognition, D1 hyperactivity, and does not worsen neurodegenerative signs. These results align with recent evidence highlighting the clinical relevance of D1 antagonists for neuropsychiatric disorders and pave the way for their use in managing psychotic symptoms in neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies."

    "abstract": "Overexpression of uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2), a key enzyme in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, is implicated in human cancer development, while its regulation under nutrient stress remains to be investigated. Here, we show that under glucose limitation, AMPK phosphorylates glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GART) at Ser440, and this modification facilitates its interaction with UCK2. Through its binding to UCK2, GART generates tetrahydrofolate (THF) and thus inhibits the activity of integrin-linked kinase associated phosphatase (ILKAP) for removing AKT1-mediated UCK2-Ser254 phosphorylation under glucose limitation, in which dephosphorylation of UCK2-Ser254 tends to cause Trim21-mediated UCK2 polyubiquitination and degradation. In this way, both UCK2 binding ability and THF producing catalytic activity of GART protect protein stability of UCK2 and pyrimidine salvage synthesis, and sustain tumor cell growth under glucose limitation. In addition, UCK2-Ser254 phosphorylation level displays a positive relationship with GART-Ser440 phosphorylation level and its enhancement is correlated with poor prognosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. These findings reveal a non-canonical role of GART in regulating pyrimidine salvage synthesis under nutrient stress, and raise the potential for alternative treatments in targeting pyrimidine salvage-dependent tumor growth."

However, few studies have synthesized and evaluated the quality of this evidence.\nObjective: To identify the relevant MAs of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that explored the association between the six pharmacotherapies and obesity-related health outcomes and adverse events (AEs).\nMethods: A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from database inception up to January 2024. We calculated the effect size as the mean difference and risk ratio using the random-effects model. The quality of MAs was evaluated using \"A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2\".\nResults: Sixteen MAs comprising 235 RCTs that described 115 unique associations between the six pharmacotherapies and various health outcomes were included. Overall, 101 statistically significant associations (88%) had beneficial outcomes on body weight, weight loss, waist circumference, body mass index, total cholesterol, triglycerides, both low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycemic profile. The pharmacotherapies were associated with significant weight loss and partial improvements in the lipid profile, blood pressure, and glycemic control among individuals with overweight or obesity. Notable AEs were associated with liraglutide, naltrexone/bupropion, semaglutide, and orlistat. The methodological quality of the included MAs requires improvement.\nConclusions: This umbrella review identified significant beneficial associations between pharmacotherapies and anthropometric measures, lipid profile, blood pressure, glycemic profile, and quality-of-life outcomes in individuals with overweight or obesity. In addition, the umbrella review highlighted safety considerations. The findings affirm the efficacy of the six pharmacotherapies in promoting weight loss in this demographic. Further clinical trials with long-term follow-up are essential to evaluate the effects of these pharmacotherapies on clinical outcomes, including cancer, cardiovascular events, and mortality."

    "abstract": "Colon cancer poses a significant threat to global health, and studies have shown a correlation between physical activity (PA) and the incidence of colon cancer. However, existing research has not quantitatively analyzed PA to evaluate its impact on the risk of colon cancer comprehensively. Data related to the study were obtained from the NHANES database for participants aged 20 and above between 2007 and 2018. Calculate the daily total metabolic equivalent (MET) based on the duration of different physical activities for each participant, use multivariate logistic regression analysis to evaluate the association between PA and colon cancer risk, perform subgroup analysis to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between different subgroups, and use RCS regression analysis to evaluate the non-linear relationship between MET and colon cancer risk. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that compared with the overall data of the participants in this study, the OR of the low PA group (PA ≤ 120MET/day) was 1.224 (95% CI 1.031-1.453, P = 0.023), the OR of the mild PA group (120 < PA ≤ 600MET/day) was 1.026 (95%CI 0.707-1.488, P = 0.894), the OR of the moderate intensity PA group (600 < PA ≤ 1200MET/day) was 0.798 (95% CI 0.506-1.258, P = 0.334), and the OR of the high-intensity PA group (PA > 1200MET/day) was 0.470 (95% CI 0.249-0.885, P = 0.022), these results are consistent in subgroup analysis. The RCS regression analysis results showed a significant nonlinear relationship between MET and the risk of colon cancer(p < 0.001), with an inflection point observed at 1879 MET/day on the correlation curve. Low physical activity increases the risk of colon cancer, while moderate to high-intensity physical activity can reduce the risk of colon cancer. The results of this study emphasize the importance of maintaining appropriate physical activity as a healthy way to prevent colon cancer."

    "abstract": "Programmed necrosis/necroptosis greatly contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiac disorders including myocardial infarction, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and heart failure. However, the fundamental mechanism underlying myocardial necroptosis, especially the mitochondria-dependent death pathway, is poorly understood. Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), a Ca2+ sensor, is originally identified in nervous system and mediates synchronous neurotransmitter release. The later findings of Syt1 expressions in many non-neuronal tissues including muscles suggest that Syt1 may exert important functions beyond regulation of neurotransmitter release. Syt1 is highly expressed in cardiomyocytes and has been used as an extracellular molecular probe for SPECT imaging of cardiac cell death in acute myocardial infarction. However, whether Syt1 functions in the pathogenesis of cardiac disorders and what is the molecular etiology have not yet been clarified. We showed here that Syt1 expression was significantly down-regulated in mice I/R injured heart tissues, H2O2-challenged cardiomyocytes and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-damaged cardiomyocytes. Enforced expression of Syt1 significantly inhibited myocardial necrotic cell death and interstitial fibrosis, and improved cardiac function in mice subjected to I/R operation. In exploring the underlying mechanisms, we found that Syt1 interacted with Parkin and promoted Parkin-catalyzed CypD ubiquitination, thus inhibited mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and ultimately suppressed cardiomyocyte necrosis. We further found that Syt1 expression was negatively regulated by miR-193b-3p. MiR-193b-3p regulated cardiomyocyte necrosis and mPTP opening by targeting Syt1. Our present work revealed a novel regulatory model of myocardial necrosis composed of miR-193b-3p, Syt1, Parkin, and CypD, which may provide potential therapeutic targets and strategies for heart protection."

    "abstract": "While all native tRNAs undergo extensive post-transcriptional modifications as a mechanism to regulate gene expression, mapping these modifications remains challenging. The critical barrier is the difficulty of readthrough of modifications by reverse transcriptases (RTs). Here we use Induro-a new group-II intron-encoded RT-to map and quantify genome-wide tRNA modifications in Induro-tRNAseq. We show that Induro progressively increases readthrough over time by selectively overcoming RT stops without altering the misincorporation frequency. In a parallel analysis of Induro vs. a related RT, we provide comparative datasets to facilitate the prediction of each modification. We assess tRNA modifications across five human cell lines and three mouse tissues and show that, while the landscape of modifications is highly variable throughout the tRNA sequence framework, it is stabilized for modifications that are required for reading of the genetic code. The coordinated changes have fundamental importance for development of tRNA modifications in protein homeostasis."

At present, the comparability of urinary proteomics data across diverse liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platforms remains an area that requires investigation. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of urinary proteome across multiple LC-MS platforms. To systematically analyze and assess the quality of large-scale urinary proteomics data, we develop a comprehensive quality control (QC) system named MSCohort, which extracted 81 metrics for individual experiment and the whole cohort quality evaluation. Additionally, we present a standard operating procedure (SOP) for high-throughput urinary proteome analysis based on MSCohort QC system. Our study involves 20 LC-MS platforms and reveals that, when combined with a comprehensive QC system and a unified SOP, the data generated by data-independent acquisition (DIA) workflow in urine QC samples exhibit high robustness, sensitivity, and reproducibility across multiple LC-MS platforms. Furthermore, we apply this SOP to hybrid benchmarking samples and clinical colorectal cancer (CRC) urinary proteome including 527 experiments. Across three different LC-MS platforms, the analyses report high quantitative reproducibility and consistent disease patterns. This work lays the groundwork for large-scale clinical urinary proteomics studies spanning multiple platforms, paving the way for precision medicine research."

    "abstract": "Cilia assembly and function rely on the bidirectional transport of components between the cell body and ciliary tip via Intraflagellar Transport (IFT) trains. Anterograde and retrograde IFT trains travel along the B- and A-tubules of microtubule doublets, respectively, ensuring smooth traffic flow. However, the mechanism underlying this segregation remains unclear. Here, we test whether tubulin detyrosination (enriched on B-tubules) and tyrosination (enriched on A-tubules) have a role in IFT logistics. We report that knockout of tubulin detyrosinase VashL in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii causes frequent IFT train stoppages and impaired ciliary growth. By reconstituting IFT train motility on de-membranated axonemes and synthetic microtubules, we show that anterograde and retrograde trains preferentially associate with detyrosinated and tyrosinated microtubules, respectively. We propose that tubulin tyrosination/detyrosination is crucial for spatial segregation and collision-free IFT train motion, highlighting the significance of the tubulin code in ciliary transport."

    "abstract": "Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a multifunctional endocytic receptor whose dysfunction is linked to developmental dysplasia of the hip, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Our work addresses the critical question of how these skeletal pathologies emerge. Here, we show the abundant expression of LRP1 in skeletal progenitor cells at mouse embryonic stage E10.5 and onwards, especially in the perichondrium, the stem cell layer surrounding developing limbs essential for bone formation. Lrp1 deficiency in these stem cells causes joint fusion, malformation of cartilage/bone template and markedly delayed or lack of primary ossification. These abnormalities, which resemble phenotypes associated with Wnt signalling pathways, result in severe and persistent skeletal defects including a severe deficit in hip joint and patella, and markedly deformed and low-density long bones leading to dwarfism and impaired mobility. Mechanistically, we show that LRP1 regulates core non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) components that may explain the malformation of long bones. LRP1 directly binds to Wnt5a, facilitates its cell-association and endocytic degradation and recycling. In the developing limbs, LRP1 partially colocalises with Wnt5a and its deficiency alters abundance and distribution of Wnt5a and Vangl2. Finally, using Xenopus as a model system, we show the regulatory role for LRP1 in Wnt/PCP signalling. We propose that in skeletal progenitors, LRP1 plays a critical role in formation and maturity of multiple bones and joints by regulating Wnt signalling, providing novel insights into the fundamental processes of morphogenesis and the emergence of skeletal pathologies."

    "abstract": "Endocrine therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors is standard for estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (ER+/HER2- MBC), yet clinical resistance develops. Previously, we demonstrated that low doses of palbociclib activate autophagy, reversing initial G1 cell cycle arrest, while high concentrations induce off-target senescence. The autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) induced on-target senescence at lower palbociclib doses. We conducted a phase I trial (NCT03774472 registered in ClinicalTrials.gov on 8/20/2018) of HCQ (400, 600, 800 mg/day) with palbociclib (75 mg/day continuous) and letrozole, using a 3 + 3 design. Primary objectives included safety, tolerability, and determining the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of HCQ. Secondary objectives included tumor response and biomarker analysis. Fourteen ER+/HER2- MBC patients were evaluable [400 mg (n = 4), 600 mg (n = 4), 800 mg (n = 6)]. Grade 3 adverse events (AEs) included hematological (3 at 800 mg), skin rash (2 at 600 mg), and anorexia (1 at 400 mg), with no serious AEs. The best responses were partial (2), stable (11), and progression (1). Tumor reductions ranged from 11% to 30%, with one 55% increase. The two partial responders sustained tumor size reductions of 30% to 55% over an extended treatment period, lasting nearly 300 days. Biomarker analysis in responders demonstrated significant decreases in Ki67, Rb, and nuclear cyclin E levels and increases in autophagy markers p62 and LAMP1, suggesting a correlation between these biomarkers and treatment response. This phase I study demonstrated that HCQ is safe and well-tolerated and the RP2D was established at 800 mg/day with continuous low-dose palbociclib (75 mg/day) and letrozole (2.5 mg/day). These findings suggest that adding HCQ could potentially enhance the efficacy of low-dose palbociclib and standard letrozole therapy, pending verification in larger randomized studies."

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease with a slow progression and a highly variable clinical outcome. The tumor suppressor genes PTEN and TP53 are frequently mutated in prostate cancer and are predictive of early metastatic dissemination and unfavorable patient outcomes. The progression of solid tumors to metastasis is often associated with increased cell plasticity, but the complex events underlying TP53-loss-induced disease aggressiveness remain incompletely understood. Using genetically engineered mice, we show that Trp53 deficiency in Pten-null prostatic epithelial cells (PECs) does not impact early cell proliferation and neoplasia formation, nor growth arrest and senescence entry at a later time. However, Trp53-deficiency enhances invasive adenocarcinoma development and promotes metastatic cell dissemination. Importantly, our single-cell transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analyses combined with histological examinations uncovered an epithelial cell population characterized by an induction of Jak/Stat3 signaling and displaying mesenchymal features. Moreover, we show that the transcriptomic signature of this cell population is prominent in tumors of patients with high-risk prostate cancer or metastatic disease. In addition, our in vivo and organoid-based experiments provide evidence that PEC plasticity occurs through bi-directional communication with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Thus, our study demonstrates that p53 loss induces a protumorigenic crosstalk between PECs and CAFs, and identifies new vulnerabilities that might be targeted to limit cancer progression."

However, how Plp1-lineage cells respond to injury and initiate the vascularized osteogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here, by employing single-cell transcriptional profiling combined with lineage-specific tracing models, we uncover that Plp1-lineage cells undergoing injury-induced glia-to-MSCs transition contributed to osteogenesis and revascularization in the initial stage of bone injury. Importantly, our data demonstrated that the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling was responsible for the transition process initiation, which was strongly activated by c-Jun/SIRT6/BAF170 complex-driven Shh enhancers. Collectively, these findings depict an injury-specific niche signal-mediated Plp1-lineage cells transition towards Gli1+ MSCs and may be instructive for approaches to promote bone regeneration during aging or other bone diseases."

Whole-genome sequencing of 51 tumors revealed intratumor heterogeneity of HPV integration, with 44% of breakpoints subclonal, and a biased distribution of integration breakpoints across the HPV genome. Four HPV physical states were identified, with at least 49% of tumors progressing without integration. HPV integration was associated with APOBEC-induced broad genomic instability and focal genomic instability, including structural variants at integration sites. HPV+ HNSCCs exhibited almost no smoking-induced mutational signatures. Heterozygous loss of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) was observed in 67% of tumors, with its downregulation confirmed by single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry, suggesting ATM haploinsufficiency contributes to carcinogenesis. PI3K activation was the major oncogenic mutation, with JAK-STAT activation in tumors with clonal integration and NF-kappa B activation in those without. These findings provide valuable insights into HPV integration in HPV+ HNSCC."

Improving bone formation driven by osteoblasts has shown promising outcomes in the prognosis of SIONFH. Isovitexin has demonstrated antioxidant properties, but its therapeutic effects on GC-induced oxidative stress and SIONFH remain unexplored. In this study, we analyzed clinical samples obtained from SIONFH patients using proteomic and bioinformatic approaches. We found an imbalance in mitochondrial homeostasis and ferroptosis-induced impairment of osteogenic capacity in SIONFH. Subsequently, we investigated the cause-and-effect relationship between mitochondria and ferroptosis, as well as the regulatory role of mitophagy in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and controlling ferroptosis. We then identified the critical involvement of SIRT3 in modulating mitochondrial homeostasis and ferroptosis. Furthermore, molecular docking and co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the strong interaction between SIRT3 and BNIP3. Strikingly, restoring SIRT3 expression significantly inhibited pathological mitophagy mediated by the BNIP3/NIX pathway. Additionally, we discovered that Isovitexin, by promoting SIRT3 expression, effectively regulated mitophagy, preserved mitochondrial homeostasis in osteoblasts, suppressed ferroptosis, and restored osteogenic capacity, leading to remarkable improvements in SIONFH. These findings reveal the effects and molecular mechanisms of Isovitexin on SIONFH and highlight the potential of targeting SIRT3 as a promising strategy to suppress mitophagy-mediated ferroptosis in osteoblasts and against SIONFH."

Possible promoters of these events include dietary emulsifiers, such as carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and polysorbate-80 (P80), which, in mice, result in altered microbiota composition, encroachment, low-grade inflammation and metabolic syndrome. While assessments of gut microbiota composition have largely focused on fecal/luminal samples, we hypothesize an outsized role for changes in mucus microbiota in driving low-grade inflammation and its consequences. In support of this notion, we herein report that both CMC and P80 led to stark changes in the mucus microbiome, markedly distinct from those observed in feces. Moreover, transfer of mucus microbiota from CMC- and P80-fed mice to germfree mice resulted in microbiota encroachment, low-grade inflammation, and various features of metabolic syndrome. Thus, we conclude that mucus-associated bacteria are pivotal determinants of intestinal inflammatory tone and host metabolism."

We report the outcome predictors of generalized MG and also evaluate the influence of high- versus low-dose prednisolone and prednisolone with or without azathioprine (AZA).\nMethods: Fifty-seven patients with generalized MG were included, who completed 2 years of follow-up. Demographic information, comorbidities, Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) class at baseline and follow-up, acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and muscle-specific kinase antibodies, decremental response, thymectomy, and treatments were recorded. Maximum doses of prednisolone, AZA, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were noted. The predictors of MGFA 0 at 3 and 6 months and minimal manifestation (MM) status at 2 years were evaluated.\nResults: MGFA 0 was achieved by 27 (47.4%) patients at 3 months, 35 (61.4%) patients at 6 months, and 46 (80.7%) patients at 12 months. At 2 years, 48 (84.2%) patients achieved the MM status and none achieved complete stable or pharmacologic remission. On multivariate analysis, AChR antibody titer (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.006-1.167; P = 0.03) and MG activity of daily living (MGADL) at 6 months (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.066-1.558; P = 0.01) predicted the MM status. Maximum dose of prednisolone and adjunctive AZA did not predict the MM status.\nConclusions: About 84.2% of patients with generalized MG, especially those with a low AChR antibody titer and MGADL < 4 at 6 months, achieved the MM status at 2 years."

    "abstract": "It is well established that sleep promotes health and welfare. Literature data suggests that sleep is a recurrent resting state that performs multiple biological functions, such as memory consolidation and regulation of glucose, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, eating behavior, and blood pressure, besides, regulating the immune system. These immunological functions depend on regular sleep and circadian rhythms, as both impact the magnitude of immune responses. Circadian rhythm is the 24-h internal clock in our brain that regulates cycles of alertness and sleepiness by responding to light changes in our environment. It encompasses physical and behavioral daily oscillations. Sleep deprivation and circadian misalignment affect immunity, and both have been related to adverse health effects and chronic diseases. Studies have shown that individuals with regular and consistent sleep patterns have a more effective immune response. Thus, understanding how sleep disturbance will affect the immune response is vital in developing interventions to prevent the health burden of irregular sleep patterns and circadian misalignment, favoring a homeostatic immune defense to microbial or inflammatory insults. Therefore, the scope of this chapter is to explore evidence that regular circadian rhythms and sleep patterns are needed for optimal resistance to infectious challenges."

Although there are limited prevalence data for this rare disease, ISWRD is associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including the Alzheimer disease (AD) and the Parkinson disease (PD), which will become increasingly prevalent in an aging population. It additionally presents in childhood developmental disorders, psychiatric disorders, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients present with unpredictable, short sleep periods over a 24-h period, with significant day-to-day and weekly variability. Symptoms manifest as insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep logs and actigraphy monitoring capture rest-activity patterns required for diagnosis. Treatment aims to enhance external circadian cues through timed light therapy, behavioral activity regimens, and melatonin, but efficacy remains quite limited. Pathophysiology of ISWRD in association with various diseases and their specific management are discussed. There is a need for further investigation of disease pathophysiology, development of widely applicable tools for diagnosis, and development of treatments."

    "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is a frequent sleep disorder leading to significant health and economic consequences. It has been proposed that individuals with insomnia may experience compromised deactivation systems of arousal, leading to a chronic state of hyperactivation of arousal known as hyperarousal, along with instability in the flip-flop system. Such disruptions may have a primarily impact on the sleep homeostatic drive process. Insomnia may indeed be associated with a disruption in the body's internal clock, known as chronodisruption. Despite the differentiation established in diagnostic nosology between insomnia disorder and circadian rhythm disorders, there is a significant body of evidence suggesting a complex interplay and frequent co-occurrence between these two conditions. In particular, circadian factors can predispose individuals to insomnia disorders, as well as precipitate and perpetuate their symptoms. Accordingly numerous pieces of evidence suggest that both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options for treating insomnia can have a resynchronization effect on circadian rhythms. The first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, according to current guidelines, is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia while pharmacologic interventions comprise of benzodiazepine receptor agonists also known as Z-drugs and short- to medium-acting benzodiazepines, melatonergic agonists such as ramelteon and melatonin 2mg prolonged release, and dual orexin receptor antagonists such as daridorexant, suvorexant, and lemborexant. At the same time, certain therapies recommended for circadian rhythm disorders can be utilized as adjunctive treatments for insomnia. Therefore, this chapter will discuss the circadian aspects of insomnia disorder and of its therapeutic approach. Furthermore, the effects of chronobiologic interventions, recommended for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, will be examined in individuals afflicted with chronic insomnia."

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex cancer, yet advances in recent years from integrated genomics methods have helped improve diagnosis, treatment, and means of patient stratification. A recent example of a powerful, multimodal method is DOGMA-seq, which can measure chromatin accessibility, gene expression, and cell-surface protein levels from the same individual cell simultaneously. Previous bimodal single-cell techniques, such as CITE-seq (Cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes), have only permitted the transcriptome and cell-surface protein expression measurement. DOGMA-seq, however, builds on this foundation and has implications for examining epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic interactions between various cell types. This technique has the potential to be particularly useful in the study of cancers such as AML. This is because the cellular mechanisms that drive AML are rather heterogeneous and require a more complete understanding of the interplay between the genetic mutations, disruptions in RNA transcription and translation, and surface protein expression that cause these cancers to develop and evolve. This technique will hopefully contribute to a more clear and complete understanding of the growth and progression of complex cancers."

    "heading": "Posttranslational modifications in cardiac metabolic remodeling mediated by metabolites: Implications for disease pathology and therapeutic potential",
    "abstract": "The nonenergy-producing or biomass-accumulating functions of metabolism are attracting increasing attention, as metabolic changes are gaining importance as discrete signaling pathways in modulating enzyme activity and gene expression. Substantial evidence suggests that myocardial metabolic remodeling occurring during diabetic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and cardiac pathological stress (e.g., myocardial ischemia, pressure overload) contributes to the progression of pathology. Within the rewired metabolic network, metabolic intermediates and end-products can directly alter protein function and/or regulate epigenetic modifications by providing acyl groups for posttranslational modifications, thereby affecting the overall cardiac stress response and providing a direct link between cellular metabolism and cardiac pathology. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the functional diversity and mechanistic roles of several types of metabolite-mediated histone and nonhistone acylation, namely O-GlcNAcylation, lactylation, crotonylation, β-hydroxybutyrylation, and succinylation, as well as fatty acid-mediated modifications, in regulating physiological processes and contributing to the progression of heart disease. Furthermore, it explores the potential of these modifications as therapeutic targets for disease intervention."

    "abstract": "Background: Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (ViV-TAVR) is associated with improved perioperative safety compared to redo surgical aortic valve replacement (redo-SAVR), but long-term outcomes remain uncertain. We therefore compare long-term outcomes of ViV-TAVR and redo-SAVR.\nMethods: The study included 1:1 propensity-matched Medicare beneficiaries with degenerated bioprosthetic valves admitted between 09/29/2011 and 12/30/2020 undergoing either redo-SAVR or ViV-TAVR. Exclusion criteria included endocarditis, other concomitant cardiac surgery, or aortic valve re-intervention during the same admission. The primary outcome was 5-year survival. Composite secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; 30-day operative mortality, stroke, or acute myocardial infarction) and major valve event-free survival (congestive heart failure readmission, endocarditis, or aortic valve reintervention). Time-to-event analyses utilized Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling.\nResults: Overall, 4,699 patients were identified including 1,775 redo-SAVR and 2,924 ViV-TAVR patients. Redo-SAVR patients were younger (median[IQR] 72[68,77] vs 79[73,84]) with less CHF(39.6% vs. 68.8%) and prior CABG (17.9% vs. 32.0%) (all p<0.05). In the propensity-matched cohorts of 1,256 patients each, redo-SAVR had higher MACE (17.4% vs 13.2%, p=0.003), but better major valve event-free (71[62,79] vs 43[38,47] months, p<0.001) and 5-year (62.3% vs 46.7%, p<0.001) survival. After stratification by Charlson Comorbidity Index, the long-term survival benefit persisted in patients of lower (67.6% vs 54.9%, p=0.001) and medium or higher-risk (55.1% vs 36.7%, p<0.001).\nConclusions: Redo-SAVR may have better long-term survival than ViV-TAVR despite greater perioperative morbidity. Clinical trial data is needed to fully inform clinical decision-making regarding degenerated bioprosthetic valve reintervention, particularly for patients with reasonable life expectancy."

    "abstract": "Background: The etiology of increased risk for reoperation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) versus prior surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is poorly understood. This study evaluated the impact of concomitant mitral and tricuspid valve disease on associated risk of TAVR explant.\nMethods: Patients undergoing aortic valve replacement after prior SAVR or TAVR were extracted from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (2011-2021). Patients were stratified by TAVR explant status and presence of severe concomitant valve disease for analyses. Risk adjustment was performed using multivariable logistic regression. Interaction terms were utilized to evaluate differential risk of concomitant valve disease for TAVR explant versus redo-SAVR.\nResults: Of 24,097 redo aortic valve replacement patients, 877 (3.6%) underwent TAVR explant. TAVR explant patients had higher rates of concomitant severe valve disease (17% vs 14%, p<0.001). Patients with severe concomitant valve disease had worse operative mortality after TAVR explant (26.2% vs 14.6%, p<0.001) and redo-SAVR (12.3% vs 6.9%, p<0.001). TAVR explant was independently associated with higher mortality (ORadj 1.3 [1.0-1.6], p=0.030). Severe mitral regurgitation (ORadj 1.2 [1.0-1.6], p=0.017), mitral stenosis (ORadj 2.0 [1.5-2.7, p<0.001), and tricuspid regurgitation (ORadj 1.6 [1.3-1.9], p<0.001) were all associated with mortality, although these factors were not associated with disproportionately higher risk during TAVR explant (p>0.05).\nConclusions: TAVR explant cases have a higher burden of severe concomitant valve disease than redo-SAVR cases. Heart teams should consider these findings when discussing initial procedure choices for patients with multi-valve disease given their extreme risk at time of TAVR explant."

Despite increasing knowledge on treatment response to these monoclonal antibodies, making the optimal choice for each individual patient remains a challenge. However, evidence of this daily challenge is lacking.\nObjective: To evaluate inter-observer agreement on the choice of biologic therapy in severe asthma patients among severe asthma specialists, based on clinical cases.\nMethods: This two-phase study included a pilot local study and an international validation study. Asthma specialists were presented 7 real-life asthma cases managed with a monoclonal antibody. Based on the clinical information provided in the cases, they were asked if they would have initiated a monoclonal antibody and, if so, their treatment of choice between a) Omalizumab, b) Mepolizumab, c) Reslizumab, d) Benralizumab and e) Dupilumab. Interobserver agreement for each question was assessed using Gwet's AC1.\nResults: Sixteen physicians from the Province of Quebec (Canada) completed the pilot survey, and 70 physicians from 26 countries completed the international survey. Gwet's AC1 for the decision to initiate a biological therapy was 0.48 in the pilot survey and 0.33 in the international survey. For the choice of therapy, agreement was 0.33 and 0.26, respectively.\nConclusions: The inter-observer agreement among asthma specialists in both the decision to initiate a biological treatment in patients with severe asthma and in the selection of treatment is weak. These results highlight the need for studies seeking reliable predictors for optimal response to biological therapies."

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular and parasitic protozoon that harbors specialized cellular structures and molecular mechanisms, including the Plant-like Vacuolar Compartment (PLVAC). The PLVAC performs multifaceted roles in the parasite, contributing to ion homeostasis, proteolysis, pH regulation, and autophagy. Despite significant efforts over the past decade to characterize the PLVAC, the proteins localized to this organelle remain largely unidentified. In this study, we utilized TurboID and genetic engineering techniques to uncover additional biological characteristics and the conferring components in the PLVAC. By exploiting the bait PLVAC proteins cathepsin L (CPL) and chloroquine resistance transporter (CRT), we identified 9 novel PLVAC-associated proteins in the compartment. Further essentiality screening reveals that TgTEPSIN is required for the parasite lytic cycle. Further phenotypic analysis demonstrated the depletion of TgTEPSIN resulted in defects in the maintenance of PLVAC, virulence in mice as well as bradyzoite differentiation. Collectively, our findings broaden the repertoire of PLVAC proteins and provide new insights into the essential component and roles of the PLVAC in T. gondii."

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a prevalent inflammatory neurodegenerative disease in young people, causing neurological abnormalities and impairment. To investigate a novel therapeutic agent for MS, we observed the impact of maresin 1 (MaR1) on disease progression in a well-known, relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (RR-EAE) mouse model. Treatment with MaR1 accelerated inflammation resolution, reduced neurological impairment, and delayed disease development by reducing immune cell infiltration (CD4+IL-17+ and CD4+IFNγ+) into the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, MaR1 administration enhanced IL-10 production, primarily in macrophages and CD4+ cells. However, neutralizing IL-10 with an anti-IL-10 antibody eliminated the protective impact by MaR1 in RR-EAE model, implying the significance of IL-10 in MaR1 treatment. Metabolism has been recognized as a critical mediator of effector activity in many types of immune cells. In our investigation, MaR1 administration significantly repaired metabolic dysregulation in CD4+ cells, macrophages, and microglia in EAE mice. Furthermore, MaR1 treatment restored defective efferocytosis in treated macrophages and microglia. MaR1 also preserved myelin in EAE mice and regulated O4+ oligodendrocyte metabolism by reversing metabolic dysregulation via increased mitochondrial activity and decreased glycolysis. Overall, in a preclinical MS animal model, MaR1 therapy has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. It also induced metabolic reprogramming in disease-associated cell types, increased efferocytosis, and maintained myelination. Moreover, our data on patient-derived PBMCs substantiated the protective role of MaR1, expanding the therapeutic spectrum of SPMs. Altogether, these findings suggest the potential of MaR1 as a novel therapeutic agent for MS and other autoimmune diseases."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate EpiColon, a novel human organotypic 3D colon microtissue prototype, developed to assess colonic drug disposition, with a particular focus on permeability ranking, and compare its performance to Caco-2 monolayers. EpiColon was characterized for barrier function using transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), morphology via histology and immunohistochemistry, and functionality through drug transport studies measuring apparent permeability (Papp). Cutoff thresholds for the permeability of FITC-dextran 4 kDa (FD4), FITC-dextran 10 kDa (FD10S), and [14C]mannitol were established to monitor microtissue integrity. Permeability of EpiColon for 20 benchmark drugs was compared with Caco-2 data, and the activity of pivotal efflux transporters, including multidrug resistance protein 1/P-glycoprotein (MDR1/P-gp), along with multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), was evaluated using selective substrates. EpiColon exhibited a physiological barrier function (272.0 ± 53.05 Ω x cm2) and effectively discriminated between high (e.g., budesonide and [3H]metoprolol) and low permeable compounds (e.g., [3H]atenolol and [14C]mannitol). The model demonstrated functional activity for key efflux transporters, with efflux ratios of 2.32 for [3H]digoxin (MDR1/P-gp) and 3.34 for sulfasalazine (MRP2 and BCRP). Notably, EpiColon showed an enhanced dynamic range in the low permeability range, differentiating Papp between FD4 and FD10S, in contrast to Caco-2 monolayers. Significant positive correlations were observed between human fraction absorbed (fabs) and logarithmically transformed Papp [AP-BL] values for both EpiColon (rs = 0.68) and Caco-2 (rs = 0.68). Furthermore, EpiColon recapitulates some essential phenotypic and cellular features of the human colon, including the expression of critical marker genes (Pan-Cytokeratin+: epithelial/colonocytes, Vimentin+: mesenchymal/fibroblast, and Alcian Blue+: goblet cell/mucus). In conclusion, EpiColon is a promising platform that offers a valuable complement to conventional Caco-2 monolayers for studying colonic drug disposition. However, the presence of flat and some cuboidal cells, along with low throughput, must be addressed to improve its applicability in both academic research and pharmaceutical industry."

The scope and methods of protocols for nutrition- and diet-related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not been investigated yet.\nObjective: Map the landscape of nutrition- and diet-related interventions research.\nMethods: We conducted a meta-research of nutrition-and diet-related RCT protocols published between January 2012 and March 2022, in any language, targeting human participants, evaluating nutrition interventions isolated or combined. A systematic search of the literature was conducted in six online databases. Bibliometric information, study characteristics, and research transparency practices data were collected from the included publications. The instructions for authors of journals with publications in our sample were checked for endorsement of reporting guidelines. Mentions to reporting guidelines in the included protocols were also checked.\nResults: Among the 62,319 records retrieved, 1,068 were eligible. The number of published protocols increased annually, with a mean of 103 (range: 32-163) publications/year. Protocols were published in 148 journals, 50 of them (33.8%) endorsed SPIRIT, 111 (75.3%) CONSORT, and 4 (2.7%) TIDieR, while 343 (32.1%) protocols mentioned SPIRIT, 297 (27.8%) CONSORT, and 20 (1.9%) TIDieR. Most protocols reported the RCT registration number (n=1,006; 94.2%) and included statements about conflicts of interest (n=952; 89.1%) and funding (n=994; 93.2%). About one third of protocols focused on adults or elderly participants (n=677; 63.4%). Most protocols described one isolated nutrition- or diet-related intervention (n=724; 67.8%), which were most frequently \"supplementation, supplements or fortification\" (n=405; 37.9%) or \"nutrition education, counselling or coordination of care\" (n=354; 33.1%). The most frequent primary outcomes reported were related to clinical status (n=308; 28.8%).\nConclusions: The number of protocols for nutrition- or diet-related RCTs published is increasing, supporting the raising awareness and the importance of promoting these publications. The support and mention of relevant reporting guidelines by journals and researchers, respectively, remain far from ideal."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Tumor suppressor gene (TSG) inactivation by epigenetic modifications contributes to the carcinogenesis and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Expression profiling and CpG methylomics revealed that a forkhead-box transcriptional factor, FOXS1, is downregulated and methylated in CRC.\nObjectives: To assess the biological functions and underlying mechanisms of FOXS1 in colorectal cancer.\nMethods: Public databases, semi-quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, MSP, and BGS were used to analyze FOXS1 expression and promoter methylation in CRC. Stable FOXS1-overexpressing or knockdown cell lines were established. Cell growth, colony formation, flow cytometry, GFP-LC3 puncta detection, Ad-mCherry-GFP-LC3B, qPCR, in vivo subcutaneous tumor model, RNA-seq, western blotting, immunofluorescence, Co-IP assays, and protein stability analysis were performed to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of FOXS1.\nResults: In CRC, FOXS1 was frequently downregulated due to promoter CpG methylation, acting as an independent prognostic marker. Moreover, FOXS1 exerts inhibitory effects on the growth of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo, while concurrently promoting CRC cell autophagy. Intriguingly, we found that FOXS1 interacted with transforming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) and FOXS1 promoted TGFBI degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway rather than the ubiquitin-proteasome system. FOXS1 was also found to facilitate the interaction between TGFBI and lysosomal associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A), leading to the translocation of TGFBI into lysosomes for degradation. Additionally, FOXS1 regulates AKT phosphorylation and FOXO3a nuclear translocation, promoting the transcription of autophagy-related genes downstream of FOXO3a. Restoration of TGFBI expression reversed the suppressive effect exerted by FOXS1 on the growth of colorectal cancer cells.\nConclusion: FOXS1 functions as a tumor suppressor that is methylated in CRC and promotes the lysosomal degradation of TGFBI, regulates cell growth and promotes autophagy in CRC through the TGFBI/AKT/FOXO3a signaling pathway. These findings indicate that FOXS1 exhibits potential as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for colorectal cancer."

However, the frequency, clinicopathologic features, and clinical impact of deletions in these genes are poorly characterized.\nMethods: Clinicopathologic correlates of STK11, KEAP1, and SMARCA4 deletion were analyzed in nonsquamous NSCLCs at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). mRNA and LKB1 protein levels were assessed via The Cancer Genome Atlas. Clinical outcomes were analyzed in patients who received ICI+/-chemotherapy at DFCI and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Analyses of each deletion excluded cases with mutations in that gene.\nResults: Among 3,194 nonsquamous NSCLCs, 14.7% had STK11 deletion (STK11DEL), 13.5% KEAP1 deletion (KEAP1DEL), and 13.7% SMARCA4 deletion (SMARCA4DEL). These deletions correlated with lower PD-L1 expression and higher disease stage, tumor mutational burden, and aneuploidy. STK11DEL, KEAP1DEL, and SMARCA4DEL each correlated with lower corresponding mRNA expression, and STK11DEL with lower LKB1 protein expression. Among 767 patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy, these deletions associated with worse objective response rates (STK11 31% vs. 45%, P=0.005; KEAP1 33% vs. 45%, P=0.03; SMARCA4 29% vs. 45%, P=0.0007), progression free survival (STK11 HR 1.5, P=0.0001; KEAP1 HR 1.4, P=0.002; SMARCA4 HR 1.6, P<0.0001), and overall survival (STK11 HR 1.7, P<0.0001; KEAP1 HR 1.5, P=0.003; SMARCA4 HR 1.7, P<0.0001). The effect of these deletions on chemoimmunotherapy outcomes was comparable to the effect of mutations in these genes. Among 1,267 patients treated with ICI alone, these deletions did not impact outcomes in the MSKCC cohort, but generally associated with worse outcomes in the DFCI cohort among KRAS-mutant cases.\nConclusions: STK11, KEAP1, and SMARCA4 deletions correlate with distinct clinicopathologic features, reduced PD-L1, and poor chemoimmunotherapy efficacy in NSCLC."

Intravenous amivantamab is associated with a 67% infusion-related reactions (IRR) rate.\nMethods: The phase 2 SKIPPirr study (NCT05663866) enrolled patients with EGFR-mutated (Ex19del/L858R) advanced NSCLC after progression on osimertinib and platinum-based chemotherapy who received intravenous amivantamab plus oral lazertinib (amivantamab-lazertinib), a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Aiming to mitigate IRRs, 4 independent prophylactic approaches were evaluated using Simon's 2-stage design with an expansion stage if a cohort passed both stages: oral dexamethasone 4-mg twice daily (BID) given on cycle (C) 1 day (D) -1; oral dexamethasone 8-mg BID given on C1D-2, C1D-1, and morning of C1D1 (5 doses); oral montelukast 10-mg once daily given on C1D-4, C1D-3, C1D-2, C1D-1, and C1D1 (5 doses); subcutaneous methotrexate 25-mg (1 dose) given anytime between C1D-7 and C1D-3. Primary endpoint was C1D1 IRR incidence.\nResults: As of 24-June-2024, 68 patients were treated across all cohorts. The dexamethasone 8-mg cohort passed stages 1 and 2 proceeding to the expansion stage, with 24 additional patients treated. At C1D1, 9/40 patients (22.5%) experienced IRRs, resulting in an ∼3-fold decrease versus historical data (67.4%). By end of C3, 10/41 (24.4%) patients in the dexamethasone 8-mg cohort experienced IRRs (grades 1-2, except 1 grade 3 on C2D1). Amivantamab-lazertinib safety and efficacy were consistent with previous reports.\nConclusion: Prophylaxis with 8-mg oral dexamethasone meaningfully reduced IRRs and can be readily implemented in clinical practice."

The seventh and eighth editions of the TNM classification for lung cancer confirmed the applicability of this staging system for SCLC. With the proposal of N2 and M1c subcategories for the ninth edition classification, we assessed the applicability to NECs.\nMethods: The database included NEC cases diagnosed between January 2011 and December 2019. Eligible cases, with valid survival time and eighth edition TNM stage, were classified as pure SCLC, combined SCLC/non-small cell carcinoma and LCNEC. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, pairwise differences using log-rank test, and prognostic groups by a Cox regression analysis.\nResults: There were 6181 pure/combined SCLC and 697 LCNEC cases available. For SCLC, survival outcome analyses included 4453 with clinical stage, and 583 with pathologic stage data. The corresponding numbers for LCNEC were 585 and 508. The SCLC data validated the ninth edition classification for lung cancer, including the proposed new subcategories, N2a, single-station ipsilateral mediastinal/subcarinal lymph node involvement, and N2b, involvement of multiple ipsilateral/subcarinal stations. The data also validated the subcategorization of M1c into M1c1 (multiple lesions in a single extrathoracic organ system) and M1c2 (involvement of multiple extrathoracic organ systems). The LCNEC data were insufficient for complete survival analysis, but the available data showed decreasing survival with increasing clinical and pathological stages.\nConclusions: The ninth edition TNM classification applies to patients with NEC and is the appropriate standard for use in clinical practice."

This study aims to evaluate the optimal application of all immunotherapy-based combination therapy for advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma, focusing on efficacy and safety.\nMethods: We systemically searched the Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PubMed for studies regarding the first-line immunotherapy-based combination therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma until April 15, 2024. We used network meta-analysis using a random effect model to facilitate direct and indirect treatment comparisons across outcomes.\nResults: Seven clinical studies, including 5542 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, were included in the network meta-analysis analysis. Regarding progression-free survival and overall survival, combined Toripalimab + Axitinib significantly outperformed other immunotherapy-based combination therapies. This regimen significantly improved progression-free survival in the intermediate/poor risk group when stratified by prognosis prediction risks compared to sunitinib alone. For the objective response rate, Avelumab + Axitinib was the most preferred strategy in the favorable-risk group, while Nivolumab + Cabozantinib was favored in the intermediate/poor-risk group compared to other immunotherapy-based combinations. The combinations of Nivolumab + Ipilimumab and Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab had favorable safety profiles.\nConclusions: Immunotherapy-based combination therapies significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival and objective response rate in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma compared to sunitinib monotherapy. However, careful monitoring and personalized treatment strategies are required to balance efficacy and safety in patients with underlying conditions. Future research should focus on optimizing treatment protocols and elucidating the mechanisms of adverse events."

    "abstract": "Background: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) introduced in childhood national immunization programs lowered vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), but replacement with non-vaccine-types persisted throughout the PCV10/13 follow-up period. We assessed PCV10/13 impact on pneumococcal meningitis incidence globally.\nMethods: The number of cases with serotyped pneumococci detected in cerebrospinal fluid and population denominators were obtained from surveillance sites globally. Site-specific meningitis incidence rate ratios (IRRs) comparing pre-PCV incidence to each year post-PCV10/13 were estimated by age (<5, 5-17 and ≥18 years) using Bayesian multi-level mixed effects Poisson regression, accounting for pre-PCV trends. All-site weighted average IRRs were estimated using linear mixed-effects regression stratified by age, product (PCV10 or PCV13) and prior PCV7 impact (none, moderate, or substantial). Changes in pneumococcal meningitis incidence were estimated overall and for product-specific vaccine-types and non-PCV13-types.\nResults: Analyses included 10,168 cases <5y from PCV13 sites and 2,849 from PCV10 sites, 3,711 and 1,549 for 5-17y and 29,187 and 5,653 for ≥18y from 42 surveillance sites (30 PCV13, 12 PCV10, 2 PCV10/13) in 30 countries, primarily high-income (84%). Six years after PCV10/PCV13 introduction, pneumococcal meningitis declined 4874% across products and PCV7 impact strata for children <5y, 3562% for 5-17y and 036% for ≥18y. Impact against PCV10-types at PCV10 sites, and PCV13-types at PCV13 sites was high for all age groups (<5y: 96100%; 5-17y: 7785%; ≥18y: 7385%). After switching from PCV7 to PCV10/13, increases in non-PCV13-types were generally low to none for all age groups.\nConclusion: Pneumococcal meningitis declined in all age groups following PCV10/PCV13 introduction. Plateaus in non-PCV13-type meningitis suggest less replacement than for all IPD. Data from meningitis belt and high-burden settings were limited."

    "abstract": "Background: Catheter ablation is an effective treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF). Pulsed field ablation (PFA) has emerged as a novel energy modality, which relies on high-voltage electric fields to achieve cardiac tissue ablation. Data on its efficacy in the elderly are scarce.\nObjective: To evaluate the procedural details and clinical outcomes of PFA in patients > 75 years old.\nMethods: Consecutive AF patients > 75 years old undergoing PFA via the FarapulseTM system were enrolled at 6 high-volume centers. Procedural details and clinical outcomes were compared with those of patients undergoing second-generation cryoballoon (CBA) and radiofrequency (RFA) ablation.\nResults: Among 983 patients, 221 underwent PFA, 216 CBA, and 546 RFA. Procedure times were shorter with PFA (72 ± 30 minutes) compared to CBA (77 ± 27 minutes) and RFA (99 ± 23 minutes) (p<0.001). Extra-PV ablation was performed in 74.2% PFA, 9.7% CBA, and 42.1% RFA (p<0.001). The major complication rate was 1.01% (n=10) and was not significantly different among groups (1 PFA, 2 CBA, and 7 RFA; p=0.578). Minor complications were observed in 1.4 % PFA, 5.1 % CBA, and 3.5 % RFA (p=0.093). The 1-year atrial tachyarrhythmia freedom in the propensity matched population was 77.2 % with PFA, 80.8 % with CBA, and 74.9 % with RFA) (p=0.52).\nConclusions: PFA was a safe and effective option for elderly patients, offering the advantage of enabling extra-PV ablation without the concern of thermal injury risk."

GPCR proteins are involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including cell growth, migration, and survival. Dysregulation of GPCR protein expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer, and GPCR proteins have been shown to modulate these processes in various types of cancer, highlighting their importance as potential therapeutic targets. In this review, we summarize the expression regulation of GPCRs in cancer cells, update the various ways by which the abnormal expression of GPCR protein affects the behavior of tumor cells, and discuss the current research directions and potentially facing problems of strategies on GPCR-targeting therapy."

    "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate changes in prescription stimulant dispensing to children aged 5 to 17 years associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the shortage of immediate-release mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall), which was announced in October 2022.\nMethods: We analyzed the 2017 to 2023 IQVIA Longitudinal Prescription Database, which captures 92% of US prescriptions. Using an interrupted time series design, we evaluated level and slope changes in the monthly stimulant-dispensing rate (number of children with stimulant dispensing per 100 000 children) in March 2020 and October 2022.\nResults: In March 2020, the monthly stimulant-dispensing rate to children declined -454.9 children per 100 000 (95% CI, -572.6 to -337.2), an 18.8% decrease relative to January 2017. After March 2020, this rate increased to 12.7 children per 100 000 per month (95% CI, 6.6-18.8). In October 2022, there was no level change (-39.7 children per 100 000; 95% CI, -189.9 to 110.5) or slope change (-12.1 children per 100 000 per month; 95% CI, -27.5 to 3.3), although estimates were negative. During October 2022, there was a level decrease in the monthly dispensing rate for immediate-release mixed amphetamine salts and a level increase in the monthly dispensing rate for dexmethylphenidate.\nConclusions: Stimulant dispensing to children declined after the pandemic began. Dispensing may also have declined after October 2022, but estimates were not significant, partly because decreased dispensing of immediate-release mixed amphetamine salts was offset by increased dispensing of other stimulants. Findings suggest the shortage may have prompted children to switch to alternative stimulants. Future research should evaluate whether any switches led to adverse events."

    "heading": "Life expectancy losses in the Gaza Strip during the period October, 2023, to September, 2024",
    "abstract": "Background: In the context of the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, the Gaza Health Ministry (GHM) has reported 45 936 fatalities and more than 10 000 individuals missing or under the rubble for the period Oct 7, 2023, to Jan 8, 2025. The scope of this death count is difficult to fully interpret because it does not account for the size and age distribution of the Gaza Strip population. Moreover, the quality of this death count has been questioned. In this study, we evaluated the quality of the GHM death count by comparing GHM data against register data, and we estimated life expectancy losses in the Gaza Strip for the period October, 2023, to September, 2024, ie, the first 12 months of the war.\nMethods: We matched individuals included in the GHM nominative list of killed individuals for the period Oct 7, 2023, to Aug 30, 2024, with individuals included in the refugee register maintained by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which covers about 66% of the Gaza Strip population. We compared proportions of matched fatalities with proportions of registered refugees in the 2017 census. We then used census data, vital registration data, and GHM fatality information since Oct 7, 2023, to produce estimates of life expectancy losses in the Gaza Strip for the first 12 months of the war. We used three scenarios for these life expectancy estimates, based on the different types of counts provided by GHM. These scenarios did not account for the indirect effect of the war.\nFindings: 21 953 (63·9%) of 34 344 individuals in the GHM list of killed individuals (and 19 744 [64·4%] of 30 673 excluding those who were not yet born at the time of the 2017 census) were matched with individuals included in the UNRWA refugee register. This proportion is similar to the proportion of registered refugees in the 2017 census (65·7%), providing additional evidence regarding the reliability of the GHM data. In the central variant, life expectancy in the Gaza Strip decreased by 34·9 years during the first 12 months of the war, about half (-46·3%) the prewar level of 75·5 years. Life expectancy losses were larger for males (-38·0 years [-51·6%]) than for females, but nonetheless, females also suffered large losses (-29·9 years [-38·6%]). Losses between the low and high variants ranged between -31·1 years (-41·1%) and -39·4 years (-52·2%) for both sexes combined.\nInterpretation: Our approach to estimating life expectancy losses in this study is conservative as it ignores the indirect effect of the war on mortality. Even ignoring this indirect effect, results show that the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip generated a life expectancy loss of more than 30 years during the first 12 months of the war, nearly halving prewar levels. Actual losses are likely to be higher.\nFunding: None."

The objective of this study was to describe the phenotype and α-synuclein distribution in peripheral tissues in 2 related PD patients (mother and daughter), who are carriers of the same variant in exon 10 of EIF4G1 (c.1216G>A, p.Gly406Arg). We used the Burghart Sniffin Sticks test for olfactory function. α-Synuclein distribution in the olfactory mucosa and skin samples was analyzed using RT-QuIC, double immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemical staining. Both patients presented with a mild motor syndrome associated with hyposmia as prominent traits; pathological α-synuclein deposits were found in the olfactory mucosa but not in the skin. The phenotype and the findings in peripheral tissues suggest that PARK18 could manifest as a \"benign\" form of PD associated with hyposmia, with a slow progression and sparse α-synuclein accumulation in the peripheral nervous system."

    "abstract": "Trans-active response DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) is the major pathological protein in motor neuron disease and TDP-43 pathology has been described in the brains of up to 50% of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-A), an age-related neuropathology characterized by severe neuronal loss and gliosis in CA1 and/or subiculum, is found in ∼80% of cases that are positive for phosphorylated TDP-43. HS-A is seen as a co-pathology in cases with AD, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC), and frontotemporal degeneration. To understand the pathogenetic relationships between HS-A and LATE-NC, mice that selectively express human TDP-43 and TDP-43 with a defective nuclear localization signal (ΔNLS) in the hippocampus, alone or in an APP/PSEN1 background, were evaluated using histology, HALO software's object recognition algorithms, and protein expression assays. Twenty-four-month-old mice expressing cytosolic TDP-43 displayed marked neuronal loss and atrophy in the hippocampus, decreased β-amyloid plaque deposition and modulation of microglia and intermediate filament activation. TDP-43ΔNLS-expressing mice survived to only ∼24 months of age whether or not they had an APP/PSEN1 background. This HS-A-like model may provide insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration seen in HS-A and in other TDP-43 proteinopathies."

    "abstract": "Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeras (PROTAC) are a bifunctional molecule that binds to a protein of interest (POI) and a ubiquitin ligase, thereby inducing the ubiquitination and degradation of POI. Many PROTACs currently utilize a limited number of ubiquitin ligases, such as von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and Cereblon. Because these ubiquitin ligases are widely expressed in normal tissues, unexpected side effects can occur. Therefore, to expand the repertoire of ubiquitin ligases that can be utilized in PROTACs, we aimed to develop a versatile system to identify suitable novel ubiquitin ligases for PROTAC-mediated protein degradation using existing PROTACs. Chimeric ubiquitin ligases are constructed by fusing VHL with the ubiquitin ligase of interest that is stably expressed in cells. An existing PROTAC that binds to VHL was added to the cells, and the POI degradation activity was evaluated. In this study, we showed that epidermal growth factor receptor can be degraded by an existing PROTAC utilizing a chimeric ubiquitin ligase that fuses VHL and endoplasmic reticulum-localized ubiquitin ligase, HRD1. These results demonstrate that this novel approach can be used to identify suitable ubiquitin ligases for PROTAC-mediated degradation using existing PROTACs. Expanding the repertoire of ubiquitin ligases that can be utilized for PROTAC by using this versatile system is expected to enable the development of more effective and specific PROTACs for cancer and other diseases."

However, the key PM2.5 components and whether PM2.5 effect may vary by obesity type, growth stage, sex, and individual/family characteristics have yet been examined. In this study, we investigated 213,907 Chinese children and adolescents aged 3-18 years in 2017-2019. Three-year average concentrations of PM2.5 and five major components were assigned to each participant's address. Multivariable mixed-effects model and weighted quantile sum regression were used to estimate the effect sizes of each component. Stratified analyses were performed by age and sex groups, with the interactive effects of a series of individual/family features evaluated. The odds ratio of childhood obesity was 1.28 (95 %CI: 1.15-1.43) for per interquartile range increase in PM2.5, with organic matter identified as the key contributor. General central obesity and mixed obesity were more sensitive to PM2.5 exposure than peripheral obesity. As children aged, the effect size of PM2.5 attenuated for general central obesity, remained unchanged for mixed obesity and increased for peripheral obesity. Females, children with obese parents, and those with lower levels of physical activity were more vulnerable than others. Other adverse effect modifiers for certain children included family with one child, low family income, and less sleep duration. Our findings emphasize that the influence of exposure to PM2.5 and its components on risk of obesity in children and adolescents should be considered comprehensively in developing adequate obesity prevention strategies."

This systematic review aims to assess the current evidence for pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment for osteoporosis in children and adults with DMD.\nMethods: Three online databases (Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library) were searched for studies that evaluated interventions for treatment or prevention of osteoporosis in DMD. Included studies had to report changes in bone mineral density (BMD) or bone mineral content (BMC) Z-scores or fracture incidence.\nResults: Nineteen studies were identified, including twelve that evaluated bisphosphonate, three evaluated testosterone (2 studies of the same patient group), one evaluated vitamin D/calcium, one teriparatide, and two evaluated vibration therapy. Only two randomised-controlled trials were found, one of intravenous bisphosphonate and one of vibration therapy. Changes in lumbar spine BMD ranged from -0.3 to +1.3 in studies of bisphosphonate and - 0.2 to 0.0 with vibration therapy, whereas this was +0.38 with testosterone and + 0.9 with vitamin D/calcium. There was limited information on impact on fracture in all studies. None of the pharmacological studies involved a fracture naïve group at baseline. In addition, none addressed a group of individuals over 18 years at baseline.\nConclusion: This systematic review provides evidence for the effectiveness of bisphosphonate therapy in improving bone density in children and adolescents with DMD. However, there is less information on the impact on fracture. The review did not find studies exclusively in those over 18 years old with DMD and limited information on non-bisphosphonate pharmacological agents."

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended first-line treatment for insomnia, but its efficacy is not well-characterized in patients across the spectrum of AUD. The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantify the effectiveness of CBT-I in improving insomnia severity and alcohol-related outcomes in adults with heavy alcohol use and/or varying levels of AUD severity and comorbid insomnia. MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched (up to February 2024) to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Multilevel meta-analyses were conducted to estimate mean differences over time in insomnia severity, measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), as well as in alcohol craving and alcohol-related psychosocial problems between CBT-I and control groups. For the number of heavy-drinking/abstinent days, incidence rate ratios were estimated. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool. Eight RCTs encompassing 426 adults (68.78 % men) were included. Compared with control conditions, CBT-I resulted in a large reduction of insomnia severity post-treatment [estimated ISI reduction = -5.51, 95% CI (-7.13 to -3.90)], which was maintained at 1-to-3-month [7 studies; estimate = -4.39, 95% CI (-6.08 to -2.70)], and 6-month follow-up [4 studies; estimate = -4.55, 95% CI (-6.77 to -2.33)]. Alcohol-related outcomes were reported less consistently, and no significant differences were found. The included trials were judged to have a low or moderate overall risk of bias for the assessment of all outcomes. CBT-I effectively reduces insomnia severity across the spectrum of AUD, supporting wide implementation in AUD prevention and treatment settings. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42023464612."

The study population was 16,759,786 hospital deliveries from 2016 to 2020. Patients with a diagnosis of another mental health condition (anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia disorder) were excluded. A multivariable binary logistic regression model was created to assess clinical and obstetric characteristics associated with ADHD. A 1-to-1 propensity score matching was performed to assess severe maternal morbidity.\nResults: A total of 33,415 patients with ADHD were identified (prevalence rate: 19.9 per 10,000 deliveries, 95% confidence interval [CI] 19.8-20.2). During the study period, the prevalence of pregnant patients with a diagnosis of ADHD increased 39.4 % from 16.5 to 23.0 per 10,000 (P-trend<0.001). Younger patients were more likely to have the diagnosis of ADHD (P<0.001), including one in 373 patients aged <25 years and one in 227 patients in aged <20 years. In a multivariable analysis, age <25 years (adjusted-prevalence rate ratio [aRR] 2.80, 95%CI 2.57-3.04), White race (adjusted-RR 2.13, 95%CI 1.83-2.47), asthma (adjusted-RR 3.68, 95%CI 3.58-3.79), tobacco use disorder (adjusted-RR 2.04, 95%CI 1.97-2.12), alcohol use disorder (adjusted-RR 2.48, 95%CI 2.13-2.89), and illicit drug use disorder (adjusted-RR 2.19, 95%CI 2.09-2.29) were associated with ADHD. A classification-tree identified that White, asthmatic patients aged ≤21 years had the highest ADHD prevalence rate (209 per 10,000 or one in 48 patients). Rates of early-term, late-preterm, and early-preterm, peri-viable deliveries and cesarean delivery were only modestly increased. In a propensity score matched model, the measured severe maternal morbidity was overall similar between the ADHD and non-ADHD groups (19.5 versus 18.1 per 1,000 deliveries, incidence rate ratio 1.08, 95 %CI 0.96-1.20).\nConclusion: This nationwide assessment suggests the prevalence of ADHD in pregnancy is gradually increasing in the United States. Observed associations with younger age, asthma, and substance use could possibly provide useful insights in perinatal care for screening, support, and treatment."

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists decrease the incidence of developing PD and are being considered for the treatment of PD.\nAreas covered: A phase 2 clinical trial of lixisenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, in the early stages of PD. The primary endpoint was the MDS-UPDRS part 3 motor changes in score from baseline to 12 months in the on-medication state, and this was improved by lixisenatide. Post hoc subgroup analysis suggested that this effect of lixisenatide was greater in the <60-year-olds than in the ≥60 years. None of the secondary/exploratory mostly non-motor endpoints were significantly altered by lixisenatide.\nExpert opinion: Although the scores between lixisenatide and placebo were statistically significantly different, the difference did not quite reach clinical significance. Lixisenatide, like exenatide, had no effect on the primary or secondary endpoints at 6 months suggesting that any benefits with GLP-1 receptor agonists in PD require long-term treatment. The apparent differences in the two age groups may be due to the bigger deterioration of motor scores in the <60-year-old group. Lixisenatide has promise but does not answer the discussion on GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment for PD."

We show that hallmark activity is spatially organized, with the cancer compartment contributing to the activity of seven out of 13 hallmarks, while the tumor microenvironment (TME) contributes to the activity of the rest. Additionally, we discover that genomic distance between tumor subclones correlates with differences in hallmark activity, even leading to clone-hallmark specialization. Finally, we demonstrate interdependent relationships between hallmarks at the junctions of TME and cancer compartments and how they relate to sensitivity to different neoadjuvant treatments in 33 bladder cancer patients from the DUTRENEO trial. In conclusion, our findings may improve our understanding of tumor ecology and help identify new drug biomarkers."

    "abstract": "Patients with colorectal cancers (CRCs) that have microsatellite instability (MSI) (MSI CRCs) face a better prognosis than those with the more common chromosomal instability (CIN) subtype (CIN CRCs) due to improved T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses. Previous investigations identified the cytosolic DNA (cyDNA) sensor STING as necessary for chemokine-mediated T cell recruitment in MSI CRCs. Here, we find that cyDNA from MSI CRC cells is inherently more capable of inducing STING activation and improves cytotoxic T cell activation by dendritic cells (DCs). Sequencing indicates that MSI cyDNA is enriched in microsatellites, which, upon DC uptake, induce anti-tumor immunity in a manner consistent with clinical MSI CRCs. DNA-damaging therapies also modulate cyDNA stimulation capacity, with radiation inducing larger cyDNA sizes and increased mitochondrial DNA content. Identifying highly stimulatory endogenous cyDNAs such as those in MSI CRCs will allow for optimized development of DNA-based STING agonist therapies to improve the responses of CIN CRCs with CIN to immunotherapies."

    "abstract": "The established protocol for the management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has traditionally involved the administration of induction chemotherapy, followed by consolidation chemotherapy, and subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation for eligible patients. However, the prognosis for individuals with relapsed and refractory AML remains unfavorable. In response to the necessity for more efficacious therapeutic modalities, targeted immunotherapy has emerged as a promising advancement in AML treatment. This comprehensive review article specifically examines classical unconjugated and toxin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies, which are currently in the preclinical phase or undergoing evaluation in clinical trials. The review delves into the proposed mechanisms through which these monoclonal antibodies elicit anti-tumor activity and identifies the challenges associated with designing targeted immunotherapy. The review focuses on targeting specific antigens in AML, including FLT3/CD125, CLL-1, CD33, CD38, CD47, CD70, and CD123."

Since then, new lines of evidence have been published related to evaluating disordered mineral metabolism and bone quality and turnover, identifying and inhibiting vascular calcification, targeting vitamin D levels, and regulating parathyroid hormone. For an in-depth consideration of the new insights, in October 2023, KDIGO held a Controversies Conference on CKD-MBD: Progress and Knowledge Gaps Toward Personalizing Care. Participants concluded that the recommendations in the 2017 CKD-MBD guideline remained largely consistent with the available evidence. However, the framework of the 2017 Guideline, with 3 major sections-biochemical abnormalities in mineral metabolism; bone disease; and vascular calcification-may no longer best reflect currently available evidence related to diagnosis and treatment. Instead, future guideline efforts could consider mineral homeostasis and deranged endocrine systems in adults within a context of 2 clinical syndromes: CKD-associated osteoporosis, encompassing increased fracture risk in patients with CKD; and CKD-associated cardiovascular disease, including vascular calcification and structural abnormalities, such as valvular calcification and left ventricular hypertrophy. Participants emphasized that the complexity of bone and cardiovascular manifestations of CKD-MBD necessitates personalized approaches to management."

Net acid excretion is primarily accomplished through the reclamation of sodium bicarbonate and the buffering of secreted protons with ammonia or dibasic phosphate, all of which require a series of highly complex and coordinated processes along the renal tubule. Flaws in any of these components lead to the development of metabolic acidosis and/or a failure to compensate fully for other systemic acidoses. Identification and diagnosis of RTA can be challenging, and the consequences of untreated RTA can be life-threatening. The use of serum and urinary indices can help elucidate the kidney's capacity to respond to acidemia, characterize these disturbances further, and guide treatment."

Weighted logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between dietary fatty acids and periodontitis and its severity. Univariable and multivariable MR analyses were performed to explore the causal association between plasma fatty acids and periodontitis.\nResults: Two types of saturated fatty acids (hexadecanoic C16:0, octadecanoic C18:0) and monounsaturated fatty acids (hexadecenoic C16:1, docosenoic C22:1) and 3 types of polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosatetraenoic C20:4, eicosapentaenoic C20:5, docosahexaenoic C22:6) were positively associated with periodontitis. Conversely, octadecadienoic (C18:2, a type of polyunsaturated fatty acid), total polyunsaturated fatty acids, and omega-6 fatty acids were negatively associated with periodontitis. Similar association patterns were also found between these fatty acids and the severity of periodontitis. Results of MR analyses revealed that no significant association was found between plasma fatty acids and periodontitis.\nConclusions: The authors provided evidence of significant associations between certain fatty acids and periodontitis and its severity, highlighting their contributory role, although the evidence does not support a causal role based on the results of MR-based analyses.\nPractical implications: The results of this study support a contributory or inhibitory role of fatty acids in the progression of periodontitis, although not as a direct cause, and underscored the importance of maintaining a balanced dietary lipid profile for periodontal health."

We aimed to evaluate if immunonutrition during neoadjuvant treatment improves patient's health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and reduces postoperative morbidity and toxicities during neoadjuvant treatment.\nMethods: A multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) was undertaken. Included patients had untreated nonmetastatic esophagogastric tumor, aged 18 ≥ years with a life expectancy of >3 months. The study was powered for 80% power to detect a clinically relevant difference in EORTC-QLQC30 with standard deviation of 15 between groups. Primary end point was the quality of life as measured by the global health status at 30 days after surgery. An intention-to-treat analysis was employed.\nResults: The study was terminated at the interim analysis stage. About 300 patients were randomized: 149 to the IMPACT group and 151 to the control-formula group. Patient groups were well-balanced in terms of age, sex, body mass index, WHO performance status, and clinical tumor stage. Analysis of the primary end point for the study of global health status at 30-day postoperatively failed to show any significant differences between the groups (55.4 ± 18.6 [IMPACT] vs. 55.9 ± 19.8 [control]; P = 0.345). No significant differences between the groups were detected in the majority of domains from EORTC QLQC30 and OG25 tools after neoadjuvant therapy and 30 days postoperatively. Finally, no significant differences were seen between groups in neoadjuvant therapy or postoperative complications, or tumor response.\nConclusion: The results of this multicenter double-blind RCT fail to demonstrate any HRQOL benefits to the utilization of immunonutrition during neoadjuvant therapy in patients with esophagogastric cancer."

Candida tropicalis is a pathogenic Candida species associated with considerable morbidity, mortality, and drug resistance issues on a global scale.\nMethodology: We report a case of a 43-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital for further management of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. During his stay in the ward, he received systemic corticosteroids for a total duration of 32 days. A broad-spectrum antibiotic (piperacillin-tazobactam) was also given due to copious amounts of tracheostomy secretions.\nResults: The patient's fever recurred following an afebrile interval of 11 days, and C. tropicalis was cultured from his blood. The yeast was highly resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole but remained susceptible to echinocandins. Unfortunately, the patient was unable to receive any echinocandin and eventually succumbed to candidemia.\nConclusions: Multilocus sequence typing was used to characterize C. tropicalis as a novel diploid sequence type (i.e., 1515) that has not been previously reported."

Patients aged < 18 years or > 65 years, with any co-morbidities, pregnant or lactating females, and those with mild or severe COVID-19 confirmed cases were excluded. Sealed envelopes were used for randomization of intervention or control. Patients are followed until there was improvement of symptoms and no development of new symptoms for over one month.\nResults: A total of 120 patients (40.16 ± 10.74 years) with COVID-19 were enrolled; 40 patients in each arm. Out of them, 44 (36.6%) were male and 76 (63.4%) were female. Fever and cough were the predominant symptoms in each group. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean duration of fever between the ivermectin, colchicine, and control groups (7.3 ± 1.68, 6.6 ± 1.58, and 7.075 ± 1.58 days, respectively).

In recent years there has been progress in the understanding of the pathogenic pathways and data suggest that NCGS has a distinct immunological profile that differs from celiac disease (CeD). This has fostered the search for a specific biomarker of NCGS.\nAreas covered: In this review we will firstly update on pioneer NCGS diagnostic tools, particularly the gluten challenge, serum IgG class antigliadin antibodies, and certain histological characteristics seen at the small intestinal biopsy. Then we will examine the most recent research on potential biomarkers of NCGS, specifically focusing on markers of damage to enterocytes, of translocation of bacteria from the gut into the bloodstream, intestinal permeability, and inflammation.\nExpert opinion: So far, no specific biomarker of NCGS has been detected. The diagnosis of NCGS still relies on clinical criteria. A gluten challenge may be useful for diagnostic purposes, however a strong nocebo effect limits the efficacy of this procedure. Additional investigation is necessary to identify biomarkers for NCGS, that may be useful to investigate the epidemiology, clinical spectrum, and natural history of this common disorder."

    "abstract": "Introduction: To target psychological support to cancer patients most in need of support, screening for psychological distress has been advocated and, in some settings, also implemented. Still, no prior studies have examined the appropriate 'dosage' and whether screening for distress before cancer treatment may be sufficient or if further screenings during treatment are necessary. We examined the development in symptom trajectories for breast cancer patients with low distress before surgery and explored potential risk factors for developing burdensome symptoms at a later point in time.\nMethods: In total, 299 patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer who scored < 7 on the distress thermometer were included between August 2017 and October 2019 at the Department of Breast Surgery, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen. Patients were followed through electronic questionnaires at baseline before surgery and after 6, 12, and 18 months. We used latent class mixed models to identify sub-groups of patients with similar development in distress, anxiety, depression, breast cancer-specific health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, and fear of recurrence over time. Logistic and multinomial regression analyses were applied to examine clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with specific symptom trajectories.\nResults: We did not identify any sub-groups of women with low distress at diagnosis who developed disabling psychological symptoms up to 18 months after diagnosis. However, we did identify a sub-group of 52% of the women who experienced persistent mild anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder [GAD]-7 score 5-9). Adjusted for baseline treatment modalities and sociodemographic characteristics, women having low social support (odds ratio [OR]: 2.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-7.87) or living with a partner (OR: 3.18; 95% CI: 1.38-7.34) were more likely to experience persistent mild anxiety.\nInterpretation: The results show that the majority of women with low distress at breast cancer diagnosis do not experience an increase in psychological symptoms over time. Screening for distress at cancer diagnosis may be an essential step to identify most breast cancer patients in need of professional support for psychological symptoms."

    "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) is a crucial signaling adaptor involved in multiple cellular events. However, its role in regulating osteoclastogenesis and energy metabolism remains unclear. Here, we report that TRAF1 promotes osteoclastogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Employing RNA-sequencing, we found that TRAF1 is markedly upregulated during osteoclastogenesis and is positively associated with osteoporosis. TRAF1 knockout inhibits osteoclastogenesis and increases bone mass in both normal and ovariectomized adult mice, without affecting bone mass in childhood. Furthermore, TRAF1 promotes osteoclast OXPHOS by increasing the phosphorylation level of AKT. Mechanistically, TRAF1 functions to inhibit TRAF2-induced ubiquitination of Gβl, a known activator of AKT, and further upregulates AKT phosphorylation. Rescue experiments revealed that the inhibitory effects of TRAF1 knockout on osteoclastogenesis, OXPHOS, and bone mass are dependent on AKT. Collectively, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized function of TRAF1 in regulating osteoclastogenesis and energy metabolism, and establish a novel TRAF1-AKT-OXPHOS axis in osteoclasts."

    "abstract": "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment and is now being explored for other diseases, such as autoimmune disorders. While the tumor microenvironment (TME) in cancer is often immunosuppressive, in autoimmune diseases, the environment is typically inflammatory. Both environments can negatively impact CAR T cell survival: the former through direct suppression, hypoxia, and nutrient deprivation, and the latter through chronic T cell receptor (TCR) engagement, risking exhaustion. Mechanisms of resistance include T cell exhaustion, dysfunction, and the impact of the TME. Chronic antigenic stimulation leads to CAR T cell exhaustion. CAR construct design, including co-stimulatory domains, hinge, transmembrane regions, promoters, the affinity of the binder site and on /off rate plays a crucial role in modulating CAR T cell function and resistance. This review discusses the impact of the in vitro development of CAR T cells, albeit in relation to the TME, on therapeutic outcomes. The use of alternative cell sources, multi-antigen targeting, and re-engineering the TME, are discussed. The review emphasizes the need for continued innovation in CAR T cell design and manufacturing to optimize therapeutic efficacy and durability, especially in the face of varying environmental challenges."

The glycoprotein microfibrillar-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) is an integrin αVβ3/5/6 ligand present in the extracellular matrix. Single-cell transcriptomics reveal MFAP4 expression in cell-types in close proximity to vascular endothelial cells including choroidal vascular mural cells and retinal astrocytes and Müller cells. Binding of the anti-MFAP4 antibody, hAS0326, makes MFAP4 inaccessible for integrin receptor interaction and thereby hAS0326 blocked endothelial cell motility in vitro. Intravitreal hAS0326 inhibited retinal vascular lesion area and neovessel volume in a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization mouse model, vascular permeability in streptozotocin-induced retinopathy and vascular leakage area in a chronic non-human primate model of DL-2-aminoadipic acid-induced retinopathy. One dose of hAS0326 showed duration of efficacy of at least 12 weeks in the latter model. Moreover, hAS0326-treatment significantly enriched gene ontology terms involving reduction of integrin binding. Our data suggest that hAS0326 constitutes a promising treatment of neovascularization and vascular leakage in retinal diseases."

A transgene expressing ZsGreen and Cre recombinase was used to identify transduction in a cell-dependent manner based on fluorescence. Cre-driven activation of tdTomato fluorescence offered superior sensitivity for transduced cells. All serotypes except AAV3B and AAV4 had high liver tropism. Fluorescence activation revealed transduction of unexpected tissues, including adrenals, testes and ovaries. Rare transduced cells within tissues were also readily visualized. Biodistribution of AAV genomes correlated with fluorescence, except in immune tissues. AAV4 was found to have a pan-endothelial tropism while also targeting pancreatic beta cells.

    "abstract": "One hallmark of cancer is the upregulation and dependency on glucose metabolism to fuel macromolecule biosynthesis and rapid proliferation. Despite significant pre-clinical effort to exploit this pathway, additional mechanistic insights are necessary to prioritize the diversity of metabolic adaptations upon acute loss of glucose metabolism. Here, we investigated a potent small molecule inhibitor to Class I glucose transporters, KL-11743, using glycolytic leukemia cell lines and patient-based model systems. Our results reveal that while several metabolic adaptations occur in response to acute glucose uptake inhibition, the most critical is increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. KL-11743 treatment efficiently blocks the majority of glucose uptake and glycolysis, yet markedly increases mitochondrial respiration via enhanced Complex I function. Compared to partial glucose uptake inhibition, dependency on mitochondrial respiration is less apparent suggesting robust blockage of glucose uptake is essential to create a metabolic vulnerability. When wild-type and oncogenic RAS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models were examined, KL-11743 mediated induction of mitochondrial respiration and dependency for survival associated with oncogenic RAS. Furthermore, we examined the therapeutic potential of these observations by treating a cohort of primary AML patient samples with KL-11743 and witnessed similar dependency on mitochondrial respiration for sustained cellular survival. Together, these data highlight conserved adaptations to acute glucose uptake inhibition in diverse leukemic models and AML patient samples, and position mitochondrial respiration as a key determinant of treatment success."

The propose of this research is to reveal the correlation between 15 indices linked to obesity and lipid levels with the concentration of serum testosterone, and incidence of testosterone deficiency (TD) among adult American men.\nMethods: The study utilized information gathered from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) carried out from 2011 to 2016. The condition known as TD is typically characterized by a total serum testosterone level that falls below 300 ng/dL. The analysis used weighted linear and logistic regression methods to announce the association between 15 obesity- and lipid-related factors and serum testosterone levels as well as TD. Subgroup analyses were further carried out to confirm and validate the findings. Additionally, restricted cubic spline plots were utilized to examine non-linear relationships. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created for the 15 factors, and the area under the curves (AUC) was calculated to assess the efficacy of each factor in detecting TD.\nResults: Among a group of 3,540 adult males, it was observed that all 15 obesity- and lipid-related indices showed a negative relationship with testosterone concentration and a direct correlation with the presence of TD. After accounting for all covariates, the analysis revealed that individuals within the highest quartile (Q4) for metabolic score for visceral fat (METS-VF) had the excellent probability of developing TD (OR = 13.412, 95%CIs: 4.222, 42.262, P < 0.001). Additionally, a non-linear relationship was detected between the METS-VF with TD. Within the model that incorporated all adjustments, the triglyceride glucose-waist to height ratio (TyG-WHtR) has the best performance for predicting TD (Overall: AUC = 0.762, 95%CIs: 0.743, 0.782, cut-off = 5.186).\nConclusion: Elevated levels of these 15 markers were inversely related to testosterone levels and were indicative of an elevated risk of TD.

The Hemoglobin A1c/High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HbA1c/HDL-C) ratio, an integrated marker of glycolipid homeostasis, may serve as a novel predictor of stroke risk.\nMethods: Our investigation utilized data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study cohort (2011-2018). Stroke cases were identified based on self-reported, physician-confirmed diagnoses. Logistic regression models were established to determine the correlation between HbA1c/HDL-C and stroke prevalence (2011) as well as between cumulative mean HbA1c/HDL-C (2011-2015) and new stroke incidence (2015-2018). Additionally, smoothed curve fitting, subgroup analyses, and interaction tests were conducted to ensure the robustness of the findings.\nResults: In the cross-sectional analysis, 8,502 participants were enrolled, of whom 189 had a history of stroke. Our findings revealed a significant positive linear relationship between HbA1c/HDL-C and stroke prevalence after adjusting for covariates (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.09-1.45). When HbA1c/HDL-C was categorized into tertiles, only the highest tertile (T3) showed a significant correlation with stroke prevalence compared to the lowest tertile (T1) (OR:1.71, 95% CI: 1.05-2.77). In the longitudinal analysis of 5,165 participants, 336 cases of new-onset stroke were identified over a follow-up period of 7 years. Adjusting for confounders, individuals with higher cumulative mean HbA1c/HDL-C exhibited an increased likelihood of new stroke incidence (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.01-1.29). Using the T1 of cumulative mean HbA1c/HDL-C as a reference, the fully adjusted OR for stroke was 1.65 (95% CI: 1.21-2.24) in T2 and 1.54 (95% CI: 1.08-2.19) in T3. The predictive value of the HbA1c/HDL-C in stroke risk assessment have been significantly improved compared to the traditional HDL-C and HbA1c. Consistent associations were observed across most stratified subgroups.\nConclusions: Elevated baseline and cumulative mean HbA1c/HDL-C levels are significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke among middle-aged and older individuals in China, underscoring the potential of HbA1c/HDL-C as a clinical marker for long-term stroke risk assessment and prevention strategies."

    "abstract": "Background: Malaria is an infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, transmitted to humans by infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Five Plasmodium species infect humans: P. vivax, P. falciparum, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi. Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an inflammatory condition that can lead to paralysis, autonomic dysfunction, respiratory failure, and sensory symptoms. GBS typically follows an infection with Campylobacter bacteria, commonly found in undercooked poultry, but is rarely associated with malaria.\nClinical presentation: A 16-year-old female patient presented to our emergency department with a 1-day history of altered mentation. She had experienced a severe global headache and fever for 3 days prior to presentation. The patient tested positive for falciparum malaria and was admitted to the ward, where she received IV artesunate and other supportive management. After 3 days of admission, she noticed weakness and numbness in her lower extremities. Subsequently, the weakness progressed upward to involve her upper extremities. After extensive workup, the patient was managed with consideration of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), and she made a complete recovery after 12 weeks.\nDiscussion: Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an acute paralytic illness often triggered by infections, particularly viral ones. It is the leading cause of sudden muscle weakness, typically following respiratory or gastrointestinal infections, with Campylobacter jejuni being the most common cause. This patient's neurological symptoms pointed to paralysis of the lower motor neurons. Guillain-Barré Syndrome is also suggested by elevated protein levels and a lack of cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. This clinical picture emerged following a Plasmodium falciparum infection. Although the specific subtype (demyelinating or axonal) was not determined in this case due to the absence of a nerve conduction study, demyelinating subtypes have been found in GBS following Plasmodium infection.\nConclusion: In conclusion, while malaria is an exceptionally rare cause of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), it should be considered in patients with recent malaria infection who present with symptoms of lower motor neuron lesions."

    "abstract": "Background: In this study, we aimed to explore the association between baseline and early changes in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the 30-day mortality rate in patients having anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5)-positive dermatomyositis with interstitial lung disease (DM-ILD).\nMethods: Overall, 263 patients with anti-MDA5 DM-ILD from four centers in China were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the impact of baseline NLR on the 30-day mortality rate in patients with anti-MDA5-positive DM-ILD. Furthermore, a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) was applied to compare the NLR variations over time between 30-day survival group and non-survival group.\nResults: Two hundred sixty-three patients with anti-MDA5-positive DM-ILD were divided into different groups based on their NLR and whether they survived or not within 30 days. The multivariate logistic regression analysis, accounting for confounding factors, identified an elevated baseline NLR as a prognostic indicator for 30-day mortality in patients with anti-MDA5-positive DM-ILD (hazard ratio 2.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18,6.00, P = 0.019). Furthermore, the GAMM results indicated that the NLR gradually increased more in the non-survival group compared with the survival group within 14 days of admission, with a daily average increase of 1.03 (β = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.75-1.31; P < 0.001).\nConclusions: We found that an elevated baseline NLR and its progressive increase are associated with 30-day mortality in patients with anti-MDA5-positive DM-ILD."

    "abstract": "Background: SHEN26 (ATV014) is an oral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor with potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic characteristics were verified in a Phase I study. This phase II study aimed to verify the efficacy and safety of SHEN26 in COVID-19 patients.\nMethods: This was a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. Mild-to-moderate adult patients with COVID-19 were recruited and randomly assigned to the high-dose (400 mg), low-dose (200 mg), or placebo groups (1:1:1). The primary outcome measure was \"changes in RNA levels on Day seven (D7)\". The second outcome measures were \"changes of RNA levels on D3, D5, D10, D28,\" \"Time of clearance of virus.\"\nResults: A total of 91 patients were recruited in this study between December 08, 2022, and January 27, 2023. Twelve patients dropped out due to a lack of examination results. Finally, the data of 79 patients (24 in the placebo group, 31 in the 200 mg group, and 24 in the 400 mg group) were analyzed. No significant differences in the baseline data were observed between the groups. The changes of viral load were significantly higher on D3 (P = 0.0119), and D5 (P = 0.0120) in 400 mg group (vs. placebo group), and the difference value achieved 1.06 log10 copies/mL on D3 and 1.21 log10 copies/mL on D5. No significant difference was found in the viral clearance time between SHEN26 administrating groups and placebo groups. Administration of SHEN26 did not enhance drug-related ADEs and did not induce ADEs, and ADE inducing drug withdrawal, dose reduction, or death. Moreover, SHEN26 did not worsen the renal function.\nConclusions: Our findings indicate a better efficacy of a high dose (400 mg) for COVID-19 treatment. These preliminary data on the efficacy and safety provide useful information and a working basis for further verification and development of SHEN26 as a novel oral small-molecule antiviral drug for treating COVID-19."

    "abstract": "Background: Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, primarily due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, leads to impaired cortisol and aldosterone production and excess adrenal androgens. Lifelong glucocorticoid therapy is required, often necessitating supraphysiological doses in youth to manage androgen excess and growth acceleration. These patients experience higher obesity rates, hypertension, and glucose metabolism issues, complicating long-term health management. Despite this, there is limited literature on effective obesity management strategies in congenital adrenal hyperplasia patients, emphasizing the need for comprehensive care approaches.\nCase presentation: We present the case of an 18-year-old Hispanic male with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia and class III obesity, who underwent a multimodal obesity treatment plan. Diagnosed shortly after birth, he experienced rapid weight gain starting at the age of 2 years, with his body mass index escalating to 52.5 kg/m2 by age 15. Initial interventions included lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy with metformin and topiramate, which were ineffective alone. Subsequently, he was treated with semaglutide, achieving an 11% body mass index reduction. Owing to ongoing metabolic dysregulation, he underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy at the age of 17 years. The surgery was well tolerated, with careful intraoperative glucocorticoid management. Post-surgery, he experienced significant improvements in body mass index, hunger, and satiety, along with a reduction in emotional overeating.\nConclusions: This case highlights the potential of an integrative, multidisciplinary approach to address severe obesity and its associated comorbidities in patients with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The successful outcomes from both pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery suggest that tailored obesity management strategies can optimize health in this unique population, reinforcing the need for further research into comprehensive obesity care in individuals with congenital adrenal hyperplasia."

    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption is an important risk factor for multiple diseases. It is typically assessed via self-report, which is open to measurement error through recall bias. Instead, molecular data such as blood-based DNA methylation (DNAm) could be used to derive a more objective measure of alcohol consumption by incorporating information from cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites known to be linked to the trait. Here, we explore the epigenetic architecture of self-reported weekly units of alcohol consumption in the Generation Scotland study. We first create a blood-based epigenetic score (EpiScore) of alcohol consumption using elastic net penalized linear regression. We explore the effect of pre-filtering for CpG features ahead of elastic net, as well as differential patterns by sex and by units consumed in the last week relative to an average week. The final EpiScore was trained on 16,717 individuals and tested in four external cohorts: the Lothian Birth Cohorts (LBC) of 1921 and 1936, the Sister Study, and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (total N across studies > 10,000). The maximum Pearson correlation between the EpiScore and self-reported alcohol consumption within cohort ranged from 0.41 to 0.53. In LBC1936, higher EpiScore levels had significant associations with poorer global brain imaging metrics, whereas self-reported alcohol consumption did not. Finally, we identified two novel CpG loci via a Bayesian penalized regression epigenome-wide association study of alcohol consumption. Together, these findings show how DNAm can objectively characterize patterns of alcohol consumption that associate with brain health, unlike self-reported estimates."

    "abstract": "Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. Triglyceride glucose index (Tyg), a convenient evaluation variable for insulin resistance, has shown associations with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. However, studies on the Tyg index's predictive value for adverse prognosis in patients with AF without diabetes are lacking.\nMethods: This retrospective study utilized electronic medical records to collect data on patients with AF hospitalized at West China Hospital from January to June 2020. Participants were categorized into three groups based on their Tyg index levels. The primary outcome, major adverse cardiovascular events, included cardiac death, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Kaplan-Meier curve, Cox proportional hazards regression model, and restricted cubic spline were employed to explore the relationship between the Tyg index and outcomes. The predictive performance of the CHA2DS2-VASc model was evaluated after incorporating the Tyg index.\nResults: The study comprised 864 participants (mean age 67.69 years, 55.32% male, 57.52% paroxysmal AF). Patients with high Tyg index had a significantly higher risk of developing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (P < 0.001, hazard ratio: 2.05, 95% confidence interval:1.65-2.56). The MACE risk in the middle Tyg group was similar to that in the low Tyg group (P = 0.1) during the 48-month follow-up period. However, focusing on the last 24 months revealed a higher MACE risk (P = 0.015) in the middle Tyg group. The restricted cubic spline analysis revealed an S-shaped correlation between Tyg and MACE. The CHA2DS2-VASc model combined with the Tyg index showed improved predictive performance and net benefit.\nConclusions: A high Tyg index is associated with poorer prognosis in patients with AF without diabetes. Integrating the Tyg index into the CHA2DS2-VASc model may enhance its predictive performance, offering clinical utility."

    "abstract": "Background: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has a high incidence rate and poor prognosis, and currently lacks effective therapies. Recently, peptide-based drugs have shown promise in cancer treatment. In this research, a new endogenous peptide called CBDP1 was discovered in ccRCC and its potential anti-cancer properties were examined.\nMethods: Peptide expression in ccRCC was analyzed using peptidomics technology to screen for potential antitumor peptides. The effects of the peptide on ccRCC growth and migration were studied through Colony Formation Assay, CCK-8 assay, Transwell Assays, Wound Healing Assay, and animal experiments. Further investigation into the antitumor mechanisms of the peptide was conducted using lentivirus transduction, Western Blot Analysis, qRT-PCR, Immunoprecipitation, Immunofluorescence, and Immunohistochemistry.\nResults: Our findings reveal that Cathepsin B Derived Peptide 1 (CBDP1) can inhibit the progression of ccRCC both in vitro and in vivo. Through mechanistic investigations, it was revealed that CBDP1 facilitates the interaction between YTHDF2 and the deubiquitinase USP5, thereby impeding the ubiquitination and degradation of YTHDF2. The upregulated YTHDF2 then binds to TRPM3 mRNA and promotes its degradation, ultimately reducing TRPM3 expression levels. These molecular events collectively contribute to the anti-cancer properties of CBDP1.\nConclusion: These data indicate that CBDP1 exerts its antitumor effects by regulating the USP5/YTHDF2/TRPM3 axis. CBDP1 emerges as a promising candidate for the treatment of ccRCC."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. Highly targeted therapies have been developed for different subtypes of breast cancer, including hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. However, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metastatic breast cancer disease are primarily treated with chemotherapy, which improves disease-free and overall survival, but does not offer a curative solution for these aggressive forms of breast cancer. Moreover, the development of chemoresistance is a major cause of therapeutic failure in this neoplasia, leading to disease relapse and patient death. In addition, chemotherapy's adverse side effects may substantially worsen health-related quality of life. Therefore, to improve the outcome of patients with breast cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy, several therapeutic options are under investigation, including the combination of chemotherapeutic drugs with natural compounds. Omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids, have drawn attention for their antitumoral properties and their preventive activities against chemotherapy-induced toxicities in breast cancer. A literature review was conducted on PubMed using keywords related to breast cancer, omega-3, chemoresistance, and chemotherapy. This review aims to provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms driving breast cancer chemoresistance, focusing on the role of ω-3 PUFAs in these recognized cellular paths and presenting current findings on the effects of ω-3 PUFAs combined with chemotherapeutic drugs in breast cancer management."

    "abstract": "Background: Menopause is a significant phase in women's health, in which the incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is significantly increased. Body fat distribution changes with age and hormone levels in postmenopausal women, but the extent to which changes in body fat distribution affect the occurrence of OSA is unclear.\nMethods: This research performed a cross-sectional analysis utilizing data from the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Body fat distribution was quantified using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in kilograms. Menopausal status and OSA symptoms were determined by questionnaire. Weighted multivariable regression analysis was utilized to investigate the correlation between menopausal status and OSA symptoms and body fat composition. We did a mediation analysis to assess how much of the effect of menopausal status on OSA symptoms was mediated through in body fat composition.\nResults: The analysis comprised 1459 individuals from NHANES, consisting of 1188 premenopausal and 271 postmenopausal women. In the weighted sample, 36.01% of premenopausal women and 53.39% of postmenopausal women had OSA symptoms. After adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and other potential confounders, menopausal status was correlated with a higher prevalence of OSA symptoms (OR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.16,2.13), and increased visceral fat mass (β = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.17). In addition, visceral fat mass exhibited a significant correlation with OSA symptoms (OR = 3.79; 95% CI: 1.61, 8.94). Mediation analysis showed that 29.76% of the effect of menopausal status on OSA symptoms was mediated through visceral fat. In age-matched analysis, postmenopausal women had higher visceral fat mass (0.63 kg vs. 0.52 kg, P = 0.02) and a higher prevalence of OSA symptoms (68.3% vs. 45.7%, P = 0.02) compared with premenopausal women; however, there was no significant difference in BMI (P > 0.05).\nConclusion: Our results suggest that menopausal status is associated with increased visceral fat accumulation and OSA symptoms prevalence. Visceral fat accumulation appears to play an important role in the development of OSA in postmenopausal women, independent of BMI; this highlights the importance of further studying this relationship."

    "abstract": "Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) ranks as the sixth most common malignancy globally. Cisplatin is the standard chemotherapy for OSCC, but resistance often reduces its efficacy, necessitating new treatments with fewer side effects. Rumex dentatus L., from the Polygonaceae family, is known for its medicinal properties, but its anticancer potential has not been thoroughly explored. This study aimed to investigate the synergy between cisplatin and an extract from the aerial parts of R. dentatus L. in treating tongue carcinoma (HNO97) in vitro, using network pharmacology, biological verification, and phytochemical analysis.\nMethods: The study included UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis, cytotoxicity assays, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis assessment, and RT-qPCR for gene expression of Bcl2, p53, and ATG7. Potential targets were identified, and mechanisms of action were examined through online databases and enrichment analyses.\nResults: The R. dentatus L. extract contained 14 phenolic aglycons. Combining cisplatin and R. dentatus L. was more effective in inhibiting proliferation, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and reducing autophagy in HNO97 cells than cisplatin alone. KEGG analysis indicated that the drug combination might work through pathways like PI3K-Akt signaling, microRNAs in cancer, and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance.\nConclusions: Combining cisplatin with R. dentatus L. may be a promising approach for treating tongue carcinoma by affecting multiple pathways, providing a new perspective for developing more effective treatments for OSCC."

    "abstract": "Metabolic flexibility is key for the function of myeloid cells. Arginine metabolism is integral to the regulation of myeloid cell responses. Nitric oxide (NO) production from arginine is vital for the antimicrobial and pro-inflammatory responses. Conversely, the arginase 1 (ARG1)-dependent switch between the branch of NO production and polyamine synthesis downregulates inflammation and promotes recovery of tissue homeostasis. Creatine metabolism is key for energy supply and proline metabolism is required for collagen synthesis. Myeloid ARG1 also regulates extracellular arginine availability and T cell responses in parasitic diseases and cancer. Cancer, surgery, sepsis and persistent inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as neuroinflammatory diseases or arthritis, are associated with dysregulation of arginine metabolism in myeloid cells. Here, we review current knowledge on arginine metabolism in different myeloid cell types, such as macrophages, neutrophils, microglia, osteoclasts, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). A deeper understanding of the function of arginine metabolism in myeloid cells will improve our knowledge on the pathology of several diseases and may set the platform for novel therapeutic applications."

    "abstract": "This study explores the effectiveness of various antifungal drugs in treating sporotrichosis caused by Sporothrix schenckii, especially in non-wild-type (non-WT) strains. The drugs tested include enilconazole (ENIL), isavuconazole (ISA), posaconazole (POS), terbinafine (TER), and itraconazole (ITC). The study involved in vitro and in vivo tests on 10 WT isolates and eight ITC non-WT isolates. Two isolates were assessed using time-kill assays, checkerboard assays, and Galleria mellonella infection models. In vitro studies have shown that all of these drugs were more effective than or equal to ITC against WT and non-WT isolates. No ITC resistance was observed with other azoles. All drugs inhibited fungal growth of WT and non-WT strains within 24 h at all incubations. ENIL and TER showed fungicidal effect against types at over 2x minimum inhibitory concentrations with no regrowth. POS was fungicidal against WT at high concentrations but not against non-WT. ISA was only fungicidal for non-WT. ITC did not exhibit any fungicidal activity. In checkerboard experiments, the combination of POS or ISA with TER showed enhanced activity against WT and non-WT strains, surpassing the combination of ITC with TER. In vivo model experiments demonstrated significantly reduced mortality rates with ENIL, POS, and TER against WT and with ENIL, ISA, POS, and TER against non-WT. The study concludes that monotherapy with ENIL, ISA, POS, and TER, and combinations of POS/TER or ISA/TER, show promise as effective antifungal treatments against S. schenckii, including ITC-non-WT isolates."

Early detection and intervention are crucial but often hindered by complex diagnostic requirements. This study aims to develop a predictive model using NHANES data, excluding biochemical indicators, to provide a simple, cost-effective tool for large-scale, non-medical screening and early prevention of adolescent MetS. After excluding adolescents with missing diagnostic variables, the dataset included 2,459 adolescents via NHANES data from 2007-2016. We used LASSO regression and 20-fold cross-validation to screen for the variables with the greatest predictive value. The dataset was divided into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio, and SMOTE was used to expand the training set with a ratio of 1:1. Based on the training set, we built eight machine learning models and a multifactor logistic regression model, evaluating nine predictive models in total. After evaluating all models using the confusion matrix, calibration curves and decision curves, the LGB model had the best predictive performance, with an AUC of 0.969, a Youden index of 0.923, accuracy of 0.978, F1 score of 0.989, and Kappa value of 0.800. We further interpreted the LGB model using SHAP, the SHAP hive plot showed that the predictor variables were, in descending order of importance, BMI age sex-specific percentage, weight, upper arm circumference, thigh length, and race. Finally, we deployed it online for broader accessibility. The predictive models we developed and validated demonstrated high performance, making them suitable for large-scale, non-medical primary screening and early warning of adolescent Metabolic syndrome.

This study evaluates 1-year outcomes of faricimab in treatment-experienced nAMD patients.\nMethods: This single-centre retrospective cohort study included patients previously treated for nAMD who switched to faricimab between November 2022 and March 2024. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), and treatment intervals were assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months.\nResults: One hundred eighty-four patients (215 eyes) were included. Patients had received a median of 18 (interquartile range [IQR] 10-28.5) anti-VEGF injections per eye over an average of 5.02 ± 11.82 years before switch. An average of 8.63 ± 2.2 faricimab injections were administered per eye over an average follow-up of 12.19 ± 2.70 months. Median BCVA decreased from 70 ETDRS letters (IQR 55-76) at baseline to 62 (IQR 47-76) at 12 months (p = 0.0038). Median CMT improved from 259.5 μm (IQR 223-299.75) at baseline to 232 μm (202.0-272.5) at 12 months (p < 0.0001). At the last follow-up, 40.2% of eyes were dry on OCT.

Our aim in the study is to determine which treatment alternatives, specifically dabrafenib plus trametinib and ICIs, are effective in adjuvant therapy and which treatment is effective as first-line metastatic therapy. This retrospective, multicenter study included 120 patients diagnosed with stage IIIB-IIID melanoma receiving both adjuvant and first-line metastatic treatment between 2007 and 2023. Data on clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment regimens and outcomes were collected. Objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Patients treated with dabrafenib plus trametinib as adjuvant therapy had the longest relapse-free survival (RFS) (median: 8.3 months), followed by those treated with interferon (4.1 months) and nivolumab (1.9 months) (p = 0.002). Metastatically, the highest ORR was observed in patients treated with dabrafenib plus trametinib (54.5%), followed by ICI (52.0%) and chemotherapy (33.3%). Similarly, DCR was superior for dabrafenib plus trametinib (86.3%) compared to ICI (70.8%) and chemotherapy (66.6%). Median PFS was 9.7 months (95% CI 7.2-12.2 months) in the whole group. This was 14.3 months (95% CI 9.6-19.0 months) with ICI, 10.3 months (95% CI 4.2-16.4 months) with BRAF/MEK inhibitors and 6.3 months (95% CI 4.7-7.9 months) with chemotherapy, which was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Dabrafenib plus trametinib showed the longest median OS (53.5 months) in metastatic patients and was significantly better than chemotherapy (33.6 months) (p < 0.001). BRAF V600E mutation, RFS > 6 months, ORR are all independent factors for OS prognosis. In our study, dabrafenib plus trametinib combination was more effective in adjuvant treatment of melanoma, while immunotherapy was more effective in metastatic first-line treatment."

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a significant cause of lifelong disability, with no available disease-modifying treatments to promote neuroprotection and axon regeneration after injury. Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a promising therapy which has proven effective at restoring lost function after SCI in pre-clinical models. However, the precise mechanism of action is yet to be determined. Here, we used an in-vivo model of SCI in adult rats that received daily PBM (660 nm, 24 mW/cm2, 1 min) and at three days post-injury, the injured spinal cord segment was harvested and subjected to whole transcriptome sequencing and subsequent pathway analysis (generally applicable gene-set enrichment (GAGE)). Pathway analysis demonstrated 1275 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after PBM treatment, of which 397 were upregulated and 878 were downregulated. Key pathways were significantly enriched, including 8.6-fold enrichment of \"neuron projection morphogenesis\" (adjusted p = 8.10 × 10- 14), with upregulation of Notch3, Slit1/Robo2 and Sema3g pathways. Ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation pathways and NADH dehydrogenase were downregulated, and there was upregulation of ATP-dependent activity, cAMP and calcium signalling pathways. Key genes in apoptotic pathways were downregulated, as were S100 and cyclo-oxygenase components. Together, our study supports the favourable effects of PBM in promoting neuroregeneration and suppressing apoptosis after neurological injury. Further findings from pathway analysis suggest that downregulation of metabolism-associated pathways is a mechanism by which acute post-injury mitochondrial dysfunction may be averted by PBM therapy."

    "abstract": "Multidrug resistance in the pathogenic fungus Candida glabrata is a growing global threat. Here, we study mechanisms of multidrug resistance in this pathogen. Exposure of C. glabrata cells to micafungin (an echinocandin) leads to the isolation of a mutant exhibiting resistance to echinocandin and azole antifungals. The drug-resistant phenotype is due to a non-synonymous mutation (R70H) in gene IPI1, which is involved in pre-rRNA processing. Azole resistance in the ipi1R70H mutant depends on the Pdr1 transcription factor, which regulates the expression of multidrug transporters. The C. glabrata Ipi1 protein physically interacts with the ribosome-related chaperones Ssb and Ssz1, both of which bind to Pdr1. The Ipi1-Ssb/Ssz1 complex inhibits Pdr1-mediated gene expression and multidrug resistance in C. glabrata, in contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae where Ssz1 acts as a positive regulator of Pdr1. Furthermore, micafungin exposure reduces metabolic activity and cell proliferation in the ipi1R70H mutant, which may contribute to micafungin tolerance."

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota disruptions after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) are associated with increased risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). We designed a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial to test whether healthy-donor fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) early after alloHCT reduces the incidence of severe aGVHD. Here, we report the results from the single-arm run-in phase which identified the best of 3 stool donors for the randomized phase. The primary and key secondary endpoints were microbiota engraftment and severe aGVHD, respectively. Three cohorts of patients (20 total) received FMT, each from a different donor. FMT was safe and effective in restoring microbiota diversity and commensal species. Microbiota engraftment, determined from shotgun sequencing data, correlated with larger microbiota compositional shifts toward donor and better clinical outcomes. Donor 3 yielded a median engraftment rate of 66%, higher than donors 1 (P = 0.02) and 2 (P = 0.03) in multivariable analysis. Three patients developed severe aGVHD; all 3 had received FMT from donor 1. Donor 3 was selected as the sole donor for the randomized phase. Our findings suggest a clinically relevant donor effect and demonstrate feasibility of evidence-based donor selection. FMT is a holistic microbiota restoration approach that can be performed as a precision therapeutic. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT06026371."

This study determined to investigate the impact of IDO1 on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells. Here, we showed that the expression of IDO1 was markedly increased in patients with glioma and associated with GBM progression. IDO1 overexpression suppressed ferroptotic cell death, reduced ROS and lipid peroxide generation in GBM cells. IDO1 expression increased the SLC7A11 mRNA stability through FTO-dependent m6A methylation. Mechanistically, IDO1 promoted the AhR expression and nuclear translocation, thus facilitating AhR recruitment at the promoter regions of FTO gene and negatively regulating its transcription. These findings demonstrate that IDO1 facilitates GBM progression by inhibiting SLC7A11-dependent ferroptosis through an IDO1-AhR-FTO axis-mediated m6A methylation mechanism."

    "abstract": "Constitutive mitochondrial dynamics ensure quality control and metabolic fitness of cells, and their dysregulation has been implicated in various human diseases. The large GTPase Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is intimately involved in mediating constitutive mitochondrial fission and has been implicated in mitochondrial cell death pathways. During ferroptosis, a recently identified type of regulated necrosis driven by excessive lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial fragmentation has been observed. Yet, how this is regulated and whether it is involved in ferroptotic cell death has remained unexplored. Here, we provide evidence that Drp1 is activated upon experimental induction of ferroptosis and promotes cell death execution and mitochondrial fragmentation. Using time-lapse microscopy, we found that ferroptosis induced mitochondrial fragmentation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, but not mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Importantly, Drp1 accelerated ferroptotic cell death kinetics. Notably, this function was mediated by the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, as overexpression of Mitofusin 2 phenocopied the effect of Drp1 deficiency in delaying ferroptosis cell death kinetics. Mechanistically, we found that Drp1 is phosphorylated and activated after induction of ferroptosis and that it translocates to mitochondria. Further activation at mitochondria through the phosphatase PGAM5 promoted ferroptotic cell death. Remarkably, Drp1 depletion delayed mitochondrial and plasma membrane lipid peroxidation. These data provide evidence for a functional role of Drp1 activation and mitochondrial fragmentation in the acceleration of ferroptotic cell death, with important implications for targeting mitochondrial dynamics in diseases associated with ferroptosis."

    "abstract": "During cold acclimation in high-latitude and high-altitude regions, japonica rice develops enhanced cold tolerance, but the underlying genetic basis remains unclear. Here, we identify CTB5, a homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) transcription factor that confers cold tolerance at the booting stage in japonica rice. Four natural variations in the promoter and coding regions enhance cold response and transcriptional regulatory activity, enabling the favorable CTB5KM allele to improve cold tolerance. CTB5 interacts with OsHox12 and targets gibberellin (GA) metabolism genes to promote GAs accumulation in anthers and facilitate tapetum development under cold stress. Moreover, CTB5 directly regulates PYL9 and improves cold tolerance at the seedling stage by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. The CTB5KM allele is selected during the cold acclimation of japonica rice to plateau habitats in Yunnan Province. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying cold adaptation in plateau japonica rice and offer potential targets for breeding cold-tolerant rice varieties."

    "abstract": "The involvement of B lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is well-established, with their early and aberrant activation being a crucial factor. However, the mechanisms underlying this abnormal activation in RA remain incompletely understood. In this study, we identified a significant reduction in MAPK4 expression in both RA patients and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse models, which correlates with disrupted B cell activation. Using MAPK4 knockout (KO) mice, we demonstrated that MAPK4 intrinsically promotes the differentiation of marginal zone (MZ) B cells. Loss of MAPK4 in KO mice enhances proximal BCR signaling and activates the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, leading to heightened B cell proliferation. Notably, B cells from MAPK4 KO mice produce significantly higher levels of IL-6, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine in RA. Furthermore, MAPK4 KO mice exhibit impaired T cell-independent humoral immune responses. Mechanistically, MAPK4 inhibits the activation of the PI3K signaling pathway in B cells by activating the IRF4-SHIP1 pathway. Treatment with the MAPK4 agonist Vacquinol-1 enhances MZ B cell differentiation in WT mice and reduces IL-6 secretion in CIA mouse models. In summary, this study reveals the diverse roles of MAPK4 in regulating of B cell functions, with potential implications for developing therapeutic strategies for RA and related autoimmune diseases."

We generated Clcn4 knockout (KO) mice by deleting exon 5 of chromosome 7 in the C57BL/6 mice. Clcn4 KO exhibited reduced social interaction and increased repetitive behaviors assessed using three-chamber and marble burying tests. Surprisingly, these symptoms were improved by Risperidone treatment, a drug commonly used to treat ASD. RNA sequencing data from mouse neural progenitor cells (mNPCs) showed that the genes regulating trans-synaptic signaling, transmembrane transport, and neuronal projection development were significantly decreased in Clcn4 knockdown (KD) cells compared to wild type (WT). Moreover, Risperidone treatment increased the genes related to the ion transmembrane transport, membrane potential, and neuron projection development in Clcn4 KD. Abnormalities in synaptic plasticity and dendritic spine formation were also observed in Clcn4 KO compared to WT. We observed that phosphorylation of SYNAPSIN, PSD95, ERK and CREB, as well as the expression of CDK5, were reduced in the brains of Clcn4 KO mice. In Clcn4 KO cortical neurons, the phosphorylation of SYNAPSIN and PSD95 expressions also decreased compared to WT, indicating disrupted synaptic function. Additionally, Sholl analysis revealed a reduction in dendritic branching and neuronal projection length in both mouse and human CLCN4 KD neurons. Finally, the decreased phosphorylation of SYNAPSIN and expression of PSD95 along with dendrite abnormalities were restored after Risperidone treatment. These data suggest that dendritic outgrowth and synapse remodeling may serve as endophenotypic targets for drug efficacy in ASD."

Here, we demonstrate that mutating the CHD6 chromatin remodeler sensitizes cells to PARP1/2 inhibitors in a manner distinct from BRCA1, and that CHD6 recruitment to DNA damage requires cooperation between PAR- and DNA-binding domains essential for nucleosome sliding activity. CHD6 displays direct PAR-binding, interacts with PARP-1 and other PAR-associated proteins, and combined DNA- and PAR-binding loss eliminates CHD6 relocalization to DNA damage. While CHD6 loss does not impair RAD51 foci formation or DNA double-strand break repair, it causes sensitivity to replication stress, and PARP1/2-trapping or Pol ζ inhibitor-induced γH2AX foci accumulation in S-phase. DNA repair pathway screening reveals that CHD6 loss elicits insufficiency in apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease (APEX1) activity and genomic abasic site accumulation. We reveal APEX1-linked roles for CHD6 important for understanding PARP1/2-trapping inhibitor sensitivity."

To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we generate a mouse model of ibrutinib resistance, in which, after initial treatment response, relapse under therapy occurrs with an aggressive outgrowth of malignant cells, resembling observations in patients. A comparative analysis of exome, transcriptome and proteome of sorted leukemic murine cells during treatment and after relapse suggests alterations in the proteasome activity as a driver of ibrutinib resistance. Preclinical treatment with the irreversible proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib administered upon ibrutinib resistance prolongs survival of mice. Longitudinal proteomic analysis of ibrutinib-resistant patients identifies deregulation in protein post-translational modifications. Additionally, cells from ibrutinib-resistant patients effectively respond to several proteasome inhibitors in co-culture assays. Altogether, our results from orthogonal omics approaches identify proteasome inhibition as potentially attractive treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients resistant or refractory to ibrutinib."

    "abstract": "The 40S ribosomal subunit recycling pathway is an integral link in the cellular quality control network, occurring after translational errors have been corrected by the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) machinery. Despite our understanding of its role, the impact of translation quality control on cellular metabolism remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal a conserved role of the 40S ribosomal subunit recycling (USP10-G3BP1) complex in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and function. The complex binds to fission-fusion proteins located at mitochondrial hotspots, regulating the functional assembly of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCSs). Furthermore, it alters the activity of mTORC1/2 pathways, suggesting a link between quality control and energy fluctuations. Effective communication is essential for resolving proteostasis-related stresses. Our study illustrates that the USP10-G3BP1 complex acts as a hub that interacts with various pathways to adapt to environmental stimuli promptly. It advances our molecular understanding of RQC regulation and helps explain the pathogenesis of human proteostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction diseases."

However, the precise mechanism by which chronic TBI initiates PD pathogenesis is not yet fully understood. In our present study, we assessed the chronic progression and pathogenesis of PD-like behavior at different intervals in TBI mice. More than half of the mice exhibited PD-like behavior at 6 months post injury. PD-like behavioral dysfunction and pathological changes were aggravated with the injured time extension in chronic phase of TBI. The loss of tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH+) neurons in the SN were partly associated with the accumulation of misfolded a-Synuclein and the cytoplasmic translocation of TDP-43 from nuclear. Moreover, the present of chronic inflammation was observed in SN of TBI mice, as evidenced by the enhancement of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive astrocytes and microgliosis post lesion. The enhanced phagocytosis of reactive microglia accounted for the reduction of dendrite spines. Our results revealed that chronic inflammation associated with the damage of TH+ neurons and the development of progressive PD-like pathology after chronic TBI in mice. Our study shed new light on the TBI-triggered molecular events on PD-like pathology.

However, our understanding of the NMJ is limited by the absence of accurate human models. Although human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived models have advanced NMJ research, their application is constrained by challenges such as limited differentiation efficiency, lengthy generation times, and cryopreservation difficulties. To overcome these limitations, we developed a rapid human NMJ model using cryopreserved MNs and SKMs derived from iPSCs. Within 12 days of coculture, we successfully recreated NMJ-specific connectivity that closely mirrors in vivo synapse formation. Using this model, we investigated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and replicated ALS-specific NMJ cytopathies with SOD1 mutant and corrected isogenic iPSC lines. Quantitative analysis of 3D confocal microscopy images revealed a critical role of MNs in initiating ALS-related NMJ cytopathies, characterized by alterations in the volume, number, intensity, and distribution of acetylcholine receptors, ultimately leading to impaired muscle contractions. Our rapid and precise in vitro NMJ model offers significant potential for advancing research on NMJ physiology and pathology, as well as for developing treatments for NMJ-related diseases."

    "abstract": "Background: Approximately 40% of individuals with diabetes worldwide are at risk of developing diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is not only the leading cause of kidney failure, but also significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, causing significant societal health and financial burdens. This study aimed to describe the burden of DKD and explore its cross-country epidemiological status, predict development trends, and assess its risk factors and sociodemographic transitions.\nMethods: Based on the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) Study 2021, data on DKD due to type 1 diabetes (DKD-T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (DKD-T2DM) were analyzed by sex, age, year, and location. Numbers and age-standardized rates were used to compare the disease burden between DKD-T1DM and DKD-T2DM among locations. Decomposition analysis was used to assess the potential drivers. Locally weighted scatter plot smoothing and Frontier analysis were used to estimate sociodemographic transitions of DKD disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).\nResults: The DALYs due to DKD increased markedly from 1990 to 2021, with a 74.0% (from 2,228,000 to 3,876,000) and 173.6% (from 4,123,000 to 11,279,000) increase for DKD-T1DM and DKD-T2DM, respectively. In 2030, the estimated DALYs for DKD-T1DM surpassed 4.4 million, with that of DKD-T2DM exceeding 14.6 million. Notably, middle-sociodemographic index (SDI) quintile was responsible for the most significant DALYs. Decomposition analysis revealed that population growth and aging were major drivers for the increased DKD DALYs in most GBD regions. Interestingly, the most pronounced effect of positive DALYs change from 1990 to 2021 was presented in high-SDI quintile, while in low-SDI quintile, DALYs for DKD-T1DM and DKD-T2DM presented a decreasing trend over the past years. Frontiers analysis revealed that there was a negative association between SDI quintiles and age-standardized DALY rates (ASDRs) in DKD-T1DM and DKD-T2DM. Countries with middle-SDI shouldered disproportionately high DKD burden. Kidney dysfunction (nearly 100% for DKD-T1DM and DKD-T2DM), high fasting plasma glucose (70.8% for DKD-T1DM and 87.4% for DKD-T2DM), and non-optimal temperatures (low and high, 5.0% for DKD-T1DM and 5.1% for DKD-T2DM) were common risk factors for age-standardized DALYs in T1DM-DKD and T2DM-DKD. There were other specific risk factors for DKD-T2DM such as high body mass index (38.2%), high systolic blood pressure (10.2%), dietary risks (17.8%), low physical activity (6.2%), lead exposure (1.2%), and other environmental risks.\nConclusions: DKD markedly increased and varied significantly across regions, contributing to a substantial disease burden, especially in middle-SDI countries. The rise in DKD is primarily driven by population growth, aging, and key risk factors such as high fasting plasma glucose and kidney dysfunction, with projections suggesting continued escalation of the burden by 2030."

    "abstract": "Burn-related neuropathic pain (BRNP) can arise following burn-induced nerve damage, affects approximately 6% of burned human patients and can result in chronic pain. Although widely studied in humans, data on BRNP or its treatment in animals is lacking. A 4-year-old domestic shorthair cat was presented with an infected, non-healing wound suspected to be a caustic burn. Initial treatments included surgical debridement, antimicrobials, and corticosteroids, but the cat developed persistent pruritus leading to self-inflicted trauma. Despite various interventions, including prednisone, chloramphenicol and cyclosporine, clinical signs persisted, leading to a referral for suspected BRNP. Additional support for neuropathic pain was provided through thermal sensitivity testing and applying a modified Neuropathic Pain Symptoms Inventory. Treatment with gabapentin, amantadine, and acupuncture yielded little improvement, prompting an increasing escalation in gabapentin dosage. The cat was then treated with gabapentin compounded with compound 194, a small molecule that is a potent and selective inhibitor of voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 (NaV1.7). The cat exhibited significant pain relief and improvements in overall condition. After gabapentin was tapered, compound 194 effectively maintained pain control. The cat's clinical condition stabilized with no adverse effects. Hematology and serum biochemistry results remained within reference intervals throughout the treatment period. This case highlights the potential of NaV1.7 inhibitors in multimodal management of neuropathic pain in animals."

The main analysis in the present study was the 30-day landmark analysis. The co-primary endpoints were cardiovascular events (a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, definite stent thrombosis, or stroke) and major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 or 5). In the 30-day landmark analysis (N = 5833), there were 1415 patients (24.3%) who underwent complex PCI.

With the increasing rates of obesity observed in children, adolescents and adults, there is an urgent need for preventive measures. Risk factors for childhood obesity include maternal overweight or obesity before conception and excessive weight gain during pregnancy. Interventions aimed at modifying maternal lifestyle during pregnancy have demonstrated minimal positive or no impact on the health of the children. The 'healthy lifestyle before and during pregnancy to prevent childhood obesity - the PRE-STORK trial' aims to provide insights into the effect of a lifestyle intervention initiated before conception and continued during pregnancy in women with overweight or obesity, on neonatal adiposity in their children.\nMethods and analysis: In this randomised, two-arm, parallel-group, controlled trial, we will include 360 women with overweight or obesity (aged 18-40; body mass index 25-44 kg/m2) and their partners. The women will be randomised to receive either standard of care or a lifestyle intervention focused on preconception body weight reduction, regular physical exercise, healthy diet and support from a mentor before and during pregnancy. The primary outcome is the difference in neonatal adiposity measured in their children at birth. Children conceived during the trial will constitute a birth cohort, monitoring the effects on their health until the age of 18 years.\nEthics and dissemination: The trial has been approved by the Regional Committee on Health Research Ethics in the Capital Region of Denmark (identification number H-22011403) and will be conducted in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki. All results, whether positive, negative and inconclusive, will be disseminated at national or international scientific meetings and in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\nTrial registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05578690 (October 2022)."

However, insulin and lidocaine combinations exceeded the subvisible particle threshold of 6000 particles ≥10 µm per container volume at T=0 hours, with insulin also exceeding the threshold in a specific PN combination at T=4 hours. pH measurements indicated minimal shifts in the PN solutions, suggesting significant buffering capacity.\nConclusion: Alprostadil and vancomycin IV solutions are physically compatible with two individualised neonatal PN solutions, with high as well as low glucose concentrations. Combinations of PN with lidocaine or insulin form subvisible particles, which could have clinical implications if administered in large volumes over extended periods of time. In clinical scenarios where there is no other option but to administer lidocaine or insulin through the same catheter lumen as PN using a Y-site connector, the use of an in-line filter is advised. Our study adds important compatibility data that can guide clinical practice in NICU settings. However, the broader application of these results requires careful consideration of the unique characteristics of each neonatal PN solution and drug combination."

    "abstract": "Background: The Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart (SCOT-HEART) trial demonstrated that management guided by coronary CT angiography (CCTA) improved the diagnosis, management, and outcome of patients with stable chest pain. We aimed to assess whether CCTA-guided care results in sustained long-term improvements in management and outcomes.\nMethods: SCOT-HEART was an open-label, multicentre, parallel group trial for which patients were recruited from 12 outpatient cardiology chest pain clinics across Scotland. Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years with symptoms of suspected stable angina due to coronary heart disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to standard of care plus CCTA or standard of care alone. In this prespecified 10-year analysis, prescribing data, coronary procedural interventions, and clinical outcomes were obtained through record linkage from national registries. The primary outcome was coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01149590) and is complete.\nFindings: Between Nov 18, 2010, and Sept 24, 2014, 4146 patients were recruited (mean age 57 years [SD 10], 2325 [56·1%] male, 1821 [43·9%] female), with 2073 randomly assigned to standard care and CCTA and 2073 to standard care alone. After a median of 10·0 years (IQR 9·3-11·0), coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction was less frequent in the CCTA group compared with the standard care group (137 [6·6%] vs 171 [8·2%]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·79 [95% CI 0·63-0·99], p=0·044). Rates of all-cause, cardiovascular, and coronary heart disease death, and non-fatal stroke, were similar between the groups (p>0·05 for all), but non-fatal myocardial infarctions (90 [4·3%] vs 124 [6·0%]; HR 0·72 [0·55-0·94], p=0·017) and major adverse cardiovascular events (172 [8·3%] vs 214 [10·3%]; HR 0·80 [0·65-0·97], p=0·026) were less frequent in the CCTA group. Rates of coronary revascularisation procedures were similar (315 [15·2%] vs 318 [15·3%]; HR 1·00 [0·86-1·17], p=0·99) but preventive therapy prescribing remained more frequent in the CCTA group (831 [55·9%] of 1486 vs 728 [49·0%] of 1485 patients with available data; odds ratio 1·17 [95% CI 1·01-1·36], p=0·034).\nInterpretation: After 10 years, CCTA-guided management of patients with stable chest pain was associated with a sustained reduction in coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction. Identification of coronary atherosclerosis by CCTA improves long-term cardiovascular disease prevention in patients with stable chest pain.\nFunding: The Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorates, Edinburgh and Lothian's Health Foundation Trust, British Heart Foundation, and Heart Diseases Research Fund."

    "abstract": "Background: In the UK, booster COVID-19 vaccinations have been recommended biannually to people considered immune vulnerable. We investigated, at a population level, whether the absence of detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG antibody (anti-S Ab) following three or more vaccinations in immunosuppressed individuals was associated with greater risks of infection and severity of infection.\nMethods: In this prospective cohort study using UK national disease registers, we recruited participants with solid organ transplants (SOTs), rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases (RAIRDs), and lymphoid malignancies. All participants were tested for anti-S Ab using a lateral flow immunoassay, completed a questionnaire on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and were followed up for 6 months using linked data from the National Health Service in England. SARS-CoV-2 infection was primarily defined using UK Health Security Agency data and supplemented with hospitalisation and therapeutics data, and hospitalisation due to SARS-CoV-2 was defined as an admission within 14 days of a positive test.\nFindings: Between Dec 7, 2021, and June 26, 2022, we recruited 21 575 participants. Anti-S Ab was detected in 6519 (77·0%) of 8466 participants with SOTs, 5594 (85·9%) of 6516 with RAIRDs, and 5227 (79·3%) of 6593 with lymphoid malignancies. COVID-19 infection was recorded in 3907 (18·5%) participants, with 556 requiring a COVID-19-related hospital admission and 17 dying within 28 days of infection. Rates of infection varied by sociodemographic and clinical characteristics but, in adjusted analysis, having detectable anti-S Ab was independently associated with a reduced incidence of infection, with incident rate ratios (IRRs) of 0·69 (95% CI 0·65-0·73) in the SOT cohort, 0·57 (0·49-0·67) in the RAIRD cohort, and 0·62 (0·54-0·71) in the lymphoid malignancy cohort. In adjusted analysis, having detectable anti-S Ab was also associated with a reduced incidence of hospitalisation, with IRRs of 0·40 (0·35-0·46) in the SOT cohort, 0·32 (0·22-0·46) in the RAIRD cohort, and 0·41 (0·29-0·58) in the lymphoid malignancy cohort.\nInterpretation: All people with immunosuppression require ongoing access to COVID-19 protection strategies. Assessment of anti-S Ab responses, which can be performed at scale, can identify people with immunosuppression who remain most at risk, providing a mechanism to further individualise protection approaches.\nFunding: UK Research and Innovation, Kidney Research UK, Blood Cancer UK, Vasculitis UK, and Cystic Fibrosis Trust."

    "abstract": "Background: Adalimumab is an effective treatment for juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis. Data are scarce on the effects of discontinuing adalimumab after control of the disease had been reached. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of discontinuing treatment in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis.\nMethods: We conducted a multicentre, double-masked, randomised, placebo-controlled trial at 20 ophthalmology and rheumatology clinics across the USA, the UK, and Australia. Patients aged at least 2 years who had controlled arthritis and uveitis for at least 1 year on adalimumab were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio using a web-based system to receive adalimumab or placebo, administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks until the 48-week visit or treatment failure. The primary outcome was the time to treatment failure, defined by recurrence of uveitis or arthritis; all participants were included in the primary and safety analysis. Unmasking occurred at treatment failure, and patients were offered open-label adalimumab through 48 weeks of follow-up. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03816397).\nFindings: 87 patients were enrolled from March 3, 2020, to Feb 14, 2024, whereafter the prespecified interim stopping criteria were met and enrolment was stopped. One patient in each group dropped out but data were included in analyses. Six (14%) of 43 patients in the adalimumab group and 30 (68%) of 44 patients in the placebo group had treatment failure (hazard ratio 8·7, 95% CI 3·6-21·2; p<0·0001). The median time to treatment failure in the placebo group was 119 days (IQR 84-243). The median time to re-establishing sustained control of inflammation in the placebo group after restarting adalimumab was 105 days (63-196). 226 non-serious adverse events occurred in the adalimumab group (7·5 events per person-year, 95% CI 6·5-8·5), and 115 non-serious adverse events occurred in the placebo group (6·8 events per person-year, 5·6-8·1). Four serious adverse events were reported, all in the adalimumab group.\nInterpretation: Discontinuing adalimumab led to higher rates of recurrence of uveitis, arthritis, or both in patients with previously controlled juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis. However, all patients who had treatment failure successfully regained control of inflammation by the end of the 48-week study period after restarting adalimumab.\nFunding: US National Institutes of Health (National Eye Institute)."

    "abstract": "Background & aims: Hepatitis B reactivation (HBVr) can occur due to a variety of immune-modulating exposures, including multiple drug classes and disease states. Antiviral prophylaxis can be effective in mitigating the risk of HBVr. In select cases, clinical monitoring without antiviral prophylaxis is sufficient for managing the risk of HBVr. This clinical practice guideline update aims to inform frontline health care practitioners by providing evidence-based practice recommendation for the management of HBVr in at-risk individuals.\nMethods: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to assess evidence and make recommendations. The panel conducted a systematic evidence review to identify new studies since publication of the first version of this clinical practice guideline in 2014. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop recommendations regarding the role of antiviral prophylaxis and monitoring without antiviral prophylaxis for management of HBVr. Clinical recommendations were based on the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations.\nResults: The panel agreed on 4 recommendations. Based on evidence and baseline risk assessment, the panel made a strong recommendation in favor of antiviral prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of HBVr. For individuals at moderate risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of antiviral prophylaxis. For individuals at low risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of monitoring alone without antiviral prophylaxis. Monitoring should be performed at 1- to 3-month intervals, and must include assessment of hepatitis B viral load in addition to assessment of alanine aminotransferase. For individuals deemed to be at-risk of HBVr, the panel agreed on a strong recommendation in favor of testing for HBV; given universal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guidance for hepatitis B for all adults 18 years and older by testing for HBV surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody, stratifying screening practices by magnitude of HBVr risk is no longer needed.\nConclusions: This document provides updated guidance for the management of HBVr in at-risk individuals. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted. This guideline is expected to require updating in 5 years from publication."

We further evaluated the moderating roles of genetic risks and individual-related factors on both multiplicative and additive scales.\nResults: The findings showed statins use was associated with an increased risk of AD development [hazard ratio (HR) 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.30)] compared with no use of statins. We further found significant negative additive interactions of statins use with APOE ε4 allele. Besides, the effects of statins use would be modified by age, sex and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).\nDiscussions: A protective effect of statins use was observed in those who carried two APOE ε4 alleles. Also, sex, age and CVDs could modify the effects of statins use, which would provide insights for the guideline of the statins therapy."

Plasma biomarkers were evaluated using Lumipulse® G600II. Logistic regression and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis were used to assess biomarker performance. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was based on CSF Aβ42/40 ratio.\nResults: Plasma pTau217 demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC=0.91), followed by pTau181 (AUC=0.88) and Aβ42/40 (AUC=0.83). In robustness analyses, only pTau217 and pTau181 performance remained consistent, while that of Aβ42/40 ratio declined with added random variability. pTau217 significantly outperformed other BBAD, with the exception of pTau181. pTau BBAD were significant predictors of baseline Mini-Mental State Examination scores.\nConclusions: Plasma pTau217, measured with Lumipulse®, is a robust and reliable BBAD for detecting amyloid pathology in a memory clinic setting, offering a practical and less invasive alternative to traditional CSF testing."

Participants were followed-up for all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for potential confounders.\nResults: The study sample included 1,375 participants free of dementia and stroke at baseline (mean age 68 ± 6y, 54 % females). During a mean follow-up of 12.7 ± 6.0 years, 224 and 172 individuals were diagnosed with all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. An interaction of ultra-processed food consumption with age was observed with regard to dementia and Alzheimer's disease (p for interaction = 0.02 and 0.007, respectively). Therefore, all analyses were stratified by the median age of 68 years. Among participants who were <68 years of age at baseline, each serving per day of ultra-processed food was associated with 13 % increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (HR = 1.13, 95 % CI:1.03-1.25), and consumption of ≥10 servings/day vs. <10 servings/day of ultra-processed food was associated with a 2.7-fold increase in Alzheimer's disease risk (HR = 2.71, 95 % CI:1.18-6.24), after adjustment for age, sex, education, total energy, metabolic factors and diet quality. The associations with all-cause dementia were less robust, and no significant findings were observed when age at baseline was 68 years or above.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that consumption of ultra-processed food in middle-age may be linked with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. Future clinical studies are warranted to assess whether reduction of ultra-processed food consumption improves brain health."

    "abstract": "Background: Changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) may contribute to the initial stages of the pathophysiological process in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hypoperfusion has been observed in several brain regions in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the clinical significance of CBF changes in the early stages of AD is currently unclear.\nObjectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics, diagnostic value and cognitive correlation of cerebral perfusion measured with arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with MCI due to AD.\nDesign, setting and participants: A total of fifty-nine MCI patients and 49 cognitively unimpaired controls (CUCs) were recruited and underwent multimodal MRI scans, including pseudocontinuous ASL, and neurocognitive testing. MCI patients were dichotomously classified according to the presence of amyloid deposition on 11C-labelled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET).\nMeasurements: The differences in CBF and expression of the AD-related perfusion pattern (ADRP), established by spatial covariance analysis in our previous study, were compared between the PiB+ MCI group and the CUC group and between the PiB+ and PiB- MCI groups. The diagnostic accuracy and correlations with cognitive function scores for CBF and ADRP expression were further analyzed.\nResults: Hypoperfusion in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) was more characteristic of patients with MCI due to AD than of those with non-AD-related MCI. The relative regional CBF value of the left precuneus best distinguished patients with MCI due to AD from CUCs and patients with MCI due to non-AD conditions. Cerebral perfusion, as indicated by either the relative regional CBF or the expression score of the ADRP, was strongly correlated with certain cognitive function scores.\nConclusions: Here, we show that changes in CBF in the precuneus/PCC are promising MRI biomarkers for the identification of an AD etiology in patients with MCI. ASL, a noninvasive and cost-effective tool, has broad application prospects in the screening and early diagnosis of AD."

Recent research highlights the significant role of lifestyle interventions, particularly physical activity and dietary habits, in mitigating cognitive decline among the elderly and preventing the progression to dementia in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). This comprehensive review explores the impact of physical exercise and dietary approaches on cognitive health, comparing strategies adopted in Western and Asian countries. Physical activity, including aerobic, resistance, balance training, and dual-task exercises, has been shown to enhance neurogenesis, improve cerebral blood flow, and delay cognitive decline. In Western countries, structured regimens such as the Mediterranean (MedDiet) and MIND diets are prominent, while Asian countries often integrate traditional mind-body practices like Tai Chi and culturally relevant diets rich in antioxidants and polyphenols. Although both regions recognize the importance of lifestyle changes in reducing dementia risk, their approaches differ significantly, shaped by cultural norms and dietary preferences. This review underscores the need for culturally tailored public health strategies to promote cognitive health globally, highlighting the importance of individualized approaches in MCI and dementia prevention."

Ten sessions of sham, 1 mA, or 2 mA stimulation were received.\nMeasurements: Cognitive outcomes were measured at baseline, after the last HD-tDCS session, and 8-weeks post-treatment. The primary outcome was change in total learning and delayed recall on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) immediately post-treatment and at 8-weeks. Secondary outcomes included measures of language, processing speed, and executive functioning. A multi-stage approach was used to examine cognitive outcomes, which included evaluation of effect sizes, statistical effects, and rate of clinically meaningful responses.\nResults: In this pilot trial, no statistically significant differences on cognitive outcomes were found between sham and active HD-tDCS immediately post-treatment (p's > 0.05). However, moderate-to-large effect sizes were identified for enhanced RAVLT total learning (Cohen's d = 0.69-0.93) and phonemic fluency (d = 1.08-1.49) for both active HD-tDCS conditions compared to sham, with rates of clinically relevant improvement between 25 and 33%.

    "abstract": "Evidence has shown that T-cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize the same epitopes may not be the exact TCR clonotypes but have slightly different TCR sequences. However, the changes in the genomic and transcriptomic signatures of these highly homologous T cells during immunotherapy remain unknown. Here, we examined the evolutionary features in circulating TCR clonotypes observed in tumors (tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-TCRs) by combining single-cell RNA/TCR sequencing of longitudinal blood samples and TCR sequencing of tumor tissue from a patient treated with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4/programmed cell death protein-1 therapy. We found frequent circulating CD8+ TIL-TCRs with identical complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3)α amino acid sequences but quasi-identical CDR3β and TCR α/β (TRA/TRB) sequences. Despite their sequence similarities, these highly homologous TIL-TCRs responded differently to immunotherapy, and exhibited distinct transcriptional signatures that were uniquely distinguished by the expression of GZMK Overall, the expression of IFNG in CD8+ T-cell subsets including highly homologous TIL-TCRs increased when the patient achieved a response, but gradually decreased as the patient developed acquired resistance. Our findings provide insight into the cross-talk between T cells in the tumor microenvironment and those in the blood, and highlight that CD8+ T cells with highly homologous TCR sequences might display divergent transcriptional states and kinetics in response to immunotherapy."

This study investigated the expression of B7-H3 across various solid tumors and developed novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting B7-H3 for CAR T cell therapy.\nMethods: Expression of B7-H3 across various solid tumors was evaluated using RNA-seq data from TCGA, TARGET, and GTEx datasets and by flow cytometry staining. B7-H3-specific mAbs were developed by immunizing mice with human B7-H3, screening with ELISA, and analyzing kinetics with surface plasmon resonance. These mAbs were used to create second-generation CAR constructs, which were evaluated in vitro and in vivo for their antitumor function.\nResults: We identified four mAb clones from immunized mice, with three demonstrating high specificity and affinity. The second-generation B7-H3 CAR T cells derived from these mAbs exhibited robust cytotoxicity against B7-H3-positive targets and successfully infiltrated and eliminated tumor spheroids in vitro. In a xenograft mouse model of glioblastoma, these CAR T cells, particularly those derived from clone A2H4, eradicated the primary tumor, and effectively controlled rechallenge tumor, resulting in prolonged survival of the xenograft mice. In vivo T cell trafficking revealed high accumulation and persistence of A2H4-derived CAR T cells at the tumor site.\nConclusions: Our results provide novel B7-H3-targeted CAR T cells with high efficacy, paving the way for clinical translation of solid tumor treatment."

This study evaluated the effects of GLP-1RAs on kidney and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nStudy design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported through May 25, 2024.\nSetting & study populations: Adult participants in RCTs with baseline eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nSelection criteria for studies: RCTs including adults (≥18 years old) with varying degrees of kidney function, including individuals with CKD characterized by a baseline eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, that compared GLP-1RAs with control treatments with respect to a composite kidney outcome, all-cause mortality, or a composite CV disease outcome. From among 212 screened studies, 12 trials involving that included participants with baseline eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were included.\nData extraction: Two independent investigators extracted the data.\nAnalytical approach: Pooled odds ratios (ORs) for composite kidney outcome, all-cause mortality, and composite CV outcome were estimated using random-effects models. Evidence certainty was assessed using the GRADE system.\nResults: 17,996 RCT participants with baseline eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were included in analyses. GLP-1RAs were significantly associated with a reduced risk of the composite kidney outcome (OR: 0.85 [95% CI 0.77-0.94]; p=0.001) with low heterogeneity (I2<0.01%). GLP-1RAs were also associated with a reduced the risk of a >30% eGFR decline (OR: 0.78, p=0.004), a >40% decline (OR: 0.76, p=0.01), and a >50% decline (OR: 0.72, p<0.001). Risk of all-cause mortality was also lower in the GLP-1RA group (OR: 0.77 [95% CI 0.60-0.98]; p=0.03), though there was high heterogeneity (I2=71.6%). Composite CV outcomes were also lower with the use of GLP-1R (OR: 0.86 [95% CI 0.74-0.99]; p=0.03; I2=40.3%). Sensitivity analyses restricted to human GLP-1 backbone agents showed enhanced benefits.\nLimitations: Inconsistent kidney outcome definitions, focus on diabetic populations in most studies, and potential publication bias.\nConclusions: GLP-1RAs improved kidney and cardiovascular outcomes, and survival in patients with CKD enrolled in an array of clinical trials."

The primary endpoint was incident liver-related events (LREs), defined as hepatic decompensation and/or hepatocellular carcinoma.\nResults: Of 12,950 patients (mean age 52 years, 41% female, 12.1% LSM >12 kPa), baseline FIB-4, at cut-offs of 1.3 (or 2.0 for age ≥65) and 2.67, classified 66.3% as low-risk and 9.8% as high-risk, leaving 23.9% in intermediate-risk zone. After classifying intermediate FIB-4 patients as low-risk if LSM was <8.0 kPa and high-risk if LSM was >12.0 kPa, 81.5%, 4.6%, and 13.9% of the full cohort were classified as low-, intermediate-, and high-risk respectively. At a median (IQR) follow-up of 47 (23-72) months, 248 (1.9%) patients developed LREs. The 5-year cumulative incidence of LREs was 0.5%, 1.0% and 10.8% in the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, respectively. Replacing LSM with Agile 3+, Agile 4, and FAST did not reduce the intermediate-risk zone or improve event prediction. Classifying intermediate FIB-4 patients by LSM <10 kPa (low-risk) and >15 kPa (high-risk) reduced the intermediate-risk zone while maintaining prediction performance.\nConclusions: Non-invasive 2-step approach by FIB-4 followed by LSM is effective in classifying patients at different risks of LREs.\nImpact and implications: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is emerging as one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide, but only a minority of patients will develop these complications. Therefore, it is necessary to use non-invasive tests instead of liver biopsy for risk stratification. Additionally, as most patients with MASLD are seen in primary care instead of specialist settings, cost and availability of the tests should be taken into consideration. In this multicentre study, the use of Fibrosis-4 index followed by liver stiffness measurement by vibration-controlled transient elastography effectively identified patients who would later develop liver-related events. The results support current recommendations by various regional guidelines on a clinical care pathway based on non-invasive tests to diagnose advanced liver fibrosis."

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health challenge, demanding continuous advancements in treatment strategies. This review explores the complexities of targeting colorectal cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the mechanisms contributing to resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The efficacy of 5-FU is enhanced by combination therapies such as FOLFOXIRI and targeted treatments like bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab, particularly in KRAS wild-type tumors, despite associated toxicity. Biomarkers like thymidylate synthase (TYMS), thymidine phosphorylase (TP), and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) are crucial for predicting 5-FU efficacy and resistance. Targeting CRC-CSCs remains challenging due to their inherent resistance to conventional therapies, marker variability, and the protective influence of the tumor microenvironment which promotes stemness and survival. Personalized treatment strategies are increasingly essential to address CRC's genetic and phenotypic diversity. Advances in immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines, along with nanomedicine-based therapies, offer promising targeted drug delivery systems that enhance specificity, reduce toxicity, and provide novel approaches for overcoming resistance mechanisms. Integrating these innovative strategies with traditional therapies may enhance the effectiveness of CRC therapy by addressing the underlying causes of 5-FU resistance in CSCs."

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by late detection and poor prognosis. Recent research highlights the pivotal role of epigenetic alter- ations in driving PDAC development and progression. These changes, in conjunction with genetic mutations, contribute to the intricate molecular landscape of the disease. Specific modifications in DNA methylation, histone marks, and non-coding RNAs are emerging as robust predictors of disease progression and patient survival, offering the potential for more precise prognostic tools compared to conventional clinical staging. Moreover, the detection of epigenetic alterations in blood and other non-invasive samples holds promise for earlier diagnosis and improved manage- ment of PDAC. This review comprehensively summarises current epigenetic research in PDAC and identifies persisting challenges. These include the complex nature of epigenetic profiles, tumour hetero- geneity, limited access to early-stage samples, and the need for highly sensitive liquid biopsy technologies. Addressing these challenges requires the standardisation of methodologies, integra- tion of multi-omics data, and leveraging advanced computational tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. While resource-intensive, these efforts are essential for unravelling the functional consequences of epigenetic changes and translating this knowledge into clinical appli- cations. By overcoming these hurdles, epigenetic research has the potential to revolutionise the management of PDAC and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Background: High prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTI), including cystitis, and concern for antimicrobial resistance justify safe and effective non-antibiotic therapies for prevention of recurrent UTI (rUTI). This study investigated the effect of a whole cranberry fruit powder supplement on incidence of culture-confirmed UTI (primary outcome) in females with rUTI history.\nMethods: This multicenter, 6-month, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study enrolled 150 healthy females (18-65 years, body mass index (BMI) >17.5-<35 kg/m2) with rUTI defined as ≥3 UTIs in the last year or at least 2 UTIs in the last 6 months, excluding those with >5 UTIs in the last 6 months. Participants consumed either 1 capsule 500 mg/day of whole cranberry powder (Pacran®) or placebo. Culture-confirmed UTIs (>108cfu/L) were assessed throughout the intervention period at unscheduled clinic visits whenever participants experienced UTI symptoms, and at baseline, 3- and 6-month clinic visits. Symptomatic suspected UTIs were defined as participant-reported UTI-associated symptoms at unscheduled visits.\nResults: Whole cranberry powder capsules reduced culture-confirmed UTI risk compared to placebo by 52% (adjusted relative risk [RR]=0.48, 95% CI=[0.26, 0.87], P=0.01); reduced Escherichia coli UTIs (RR=0.49, 95% CI=[0.24, 1.01], P=0.05); reduced incidence of UTI with urinary frequency and urgency symptomatology (RR=0.29, 95% CI=[0.13, 0.63], P<0.01); delayed time to first UTI episode (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]=0.36, 95% CI=[0.18, 0.74], P=0.01); and reduced the mean total number of UTIs per participant (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.41, 95% CI=[0.21, 0.79], P=0.01). Significant differences between groups in incidence of symptomatic suspected UTIs, and culture-confirmed dysuria were not observed. Exploratory scores for UTI-related female sexual matters, assessed in a sub-set of sexually active, consenting females, did not differ significantly between groups. No safety concerns were reported.\nConclusion: This study showed that whole cranberry powder capsules do not impact safety markers and reduce the incidence of culture-confirmed UTI and several other UTI-related outcomes in healthy females with rUTI history.\nClinical trials registration: Registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03042273)."

    "abstract": "Globally, over 768 million confirmed cases and 6.9 million deaths had been documented as of July 17, 2023. Coronaviruses have a relatively large RNA genome. As with other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 does have an envelope film produced from host cells that are assisted by virally encoded glycoproteins that are required for infectivity, immunological assault, and viral particle production. Although the intermediate source of origin and transmission to humans is unexplained, rapid transmission from human to human has been established. This review focuses on the mechanistic framework for understanding the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Additionally, it discusses the origins and implications of COVID-19 using direct quotations from the published scientific literature to avoid misinterpretation of this catastrophic event that resulted in a massive loss of human life and impact on the global economy. The current available information unfolds large number of topics related with COVID-19 and/or the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible of the disease. This review article also delves into the multifaceted aspects of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2, with a specific focus on a controversial yet essential issue: the possible association between SARS-CoV-2's origin and aldose reductase, an enzyme known for its role in diabetic retinopathy. Exploring this connection holds utmost significance, offering valuable insights into COVID-19's pathogenesis and unlocking new avenues for therapeutic interventions. It is important to trace back the evolution of coronaviruses and reveal the possible origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."

Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline analyses were applied to assess above relationship. A two-sample MR analysis was performed using the genome-wide association study summary statistics to identify the causal association between gout and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D).\nResults: The results from both samples confirmed a positive correlation among hyperuricemia, gout and risk of Vitamin D deficiency. The restricted cubic spline showed positive dose-response relationship between uric acid and risk of Vitamin D deficiency and the minimal threshold of uric acid at 307.5 umol/L and 316.1 umol/L, respectively. Mediation analysis in the sample 2 found that about 29.4% of the total effect of gout on Vitamin D deficiency were mediated by serum uric acid, and 37.1% of which were mediated by body mass index.The results of our MR analysis supported a causal association between gout (IVW β(SE), -0.843 (0.337); P = 0.0123) and 25(OH)D. Sensitivity analysis and genetic risk scores approach confirmed the robustness and reliability of the above findings.\nConclusions: Hyperuricemia and gout are both strong indicators of increased risk of Vitamin D deficiency. Findings highlight the causal effects of gout-associated genetic variants on 25(OH)D."

Children with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and T-cell dysfunction are at high risk for CMV infection, which can be complicated by refractory and/or resistant cases. This case describes a Nepalese girl with MHC class II deficiency, who presented at 3 months of age with CMV and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was planned as a curative treatment for IEI. Initial antiviral therapy with ganciclovir, followed by foscarnet, achieved undetectable CMV viral loads. However, the viral load rebounded during foscarnet therapy. HSCT was performed at 7 months of age using peripheral blood stem cells from her CMV-seropositive father, despite the recipient's high CMV viral load. Empiric combination therapy with cidofovir (an unapproved drug in Japan), foscarnet, leflunomide, and artesunate was initiated. CMV genetic testing revealed UL54 mutations conferring high-level resistance to foscarnet and moderate-level resistance to ganciclovir. The regimen was adjusted to letermovir, ganciclovir, leflunomide, and artesunate, which successfully suppressed the viral load following engraftment. At three months post-HSCT, combination therapy was discontinued after sustained undetectable CMV viral loads. Although CMV infection was controlled, the patient died from idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage at five months post-HSCT. This case highlights the efficacy of a letermovir-inclusive therapy regimen in managing drug-resistant CMV with UL54 mutations in a pediatric HSCT recipient."

STS extracts were examined by LC-MS proteomic analysis and targeted metabolomics.\nResults: Approximately 2,500 individual proteins were identified in STS extracts. 490 proteins were present in ≥80% of AD and HV skin samples and differentially expressed in AD skin. 249 proteins were significantly reduced (cluster 1) and 136 were significantly increased (cluster 2) in AD skin (both p<0.0001 compared to HV). Functionally, cluster 1 included proteins involved in epidermal barrier formation, lysosomal enzymes required for lamellae assembly, and oxidative response. Cluster 2 was enriched for markers of epidermal hyperplasia, glycolytic enzymes and actin filament proteins. Significant increase in cluster 1 and significant inhibition in cluster 2 proteins expression was achieved in AD skin by 16-weeks of dupilumab treatment (p<0.0001 for both, compared to baseline) and approached HV skin levels. These improvements were also revealed in differential metabolite changes in STS extracts, including amino acids, nucleotide breakdown products and antioxidants.\nConclusion: Longitudinal integrated assessment of the skin proteome and metabolome in AD patients treated with dupilumab established significant inhibition of epidermal hyperplasia and improvement in epidermal differentiation. Identified changes were linked to improvements in clinical AD skin assessments, including TEWL and disease severity.\nClinical implications: Mass spectrometry analysis identifies molecular improvements in skin protein and metabolite composition in AD patients and their relationship to targeted suppression of IL-4/IL-13 signaling by dupilumab treatment and clinical response.\nCapsule summary: The study performed longitudinal sampling and analysis of skin samples of AD patients treated by dupilumab and provided evaluation of structural and inflammatory protein components of skin barrier, skin metabolites and their changes on treatment."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have risen exponentially in usage and have been shown to exert neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects across multiple organ systems. This study investigates whether GLP-1RAs influence the risk for age-related ocular diseases.\nDesign: Retrospective cohort study.\nSubjects and participants: This study utilized an electronic health records platform of patients in the United States. Patients older than 60 years of age with at least five years of ophthalmology follow-up and medication prescription documentation were included. Patients were categorized into five medication groups: GLP-1RAs, metformin, insulin, statins, or aspirin users. Cohorts were propensity-matched on demographics and chronic health conditions using a greedy matching algorithm.\nMain outcome measures: Outcomes of cataract, ocular hypertension, primary open angle glaucoma, non-exudative AMD, and exudative AMD were compared five years following initial medication prescription. We then examined earlier timepoints within the five-year period. Significance was defined as p<0.05 and HR threshold > 1.1 or < 0.9 to improve signal to noise ratio.\nResults: Of the 9,669 patients taking GLP-1RAs, 84.4 percent were diabetic with an average BMI of 36.2. Propensity matched cohorts demonstrated GLP-1RAs were associated with reduced hazard of non-exudative AMD compared to metformin (HR 0.68, 95%CI: 0.56-0.84), insulin (HR 0.72, 95%CI: 0.58-0.89), and statins (HR 0.7, 95%CI: 0.57-0.87). These findings were validated compared to aspirin and in an independent older cohort of patients. This significant reduction appeared after three years compared to metformin (HR 0.69, 95%CI: 0.52-0.91), insulin (HR 0.66, 95%CI: 0.5-0.87), and statins (HR 0.67, 95%CI: 0.51-0.88). Time course results were validated using independent cohorts of propensity matched patients taking medications for three years. Notably, GLP-1RAs also significantly reduced the risk of exudative AMD (HR 0.7, 95%CI: 0.58-0.84) and POAG (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45-0.76) compared to insulin after three years. Usage of GLP-1RAs showed no persistent significant impact on the risk of cataract formation nor ocular hypertension after five years compared other medications.\nConclusions: This study suggests GLP-1RAs may reduce the risk of multiple age-related ocular diseases and suggests the need for future prospective studies to validate these findings."

This study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2015-2020) to investigate the relationship between MetS and depression and assess the mediating role of inflammatory markers.\nMethods: This cross-sectional study included 20,520 participants. MetS was defined using the NCEP ATP III criteria. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), with scores ≥10 indicating clinical significance. Inflammatory markers evaluated included C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), among others. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were applied to examine associations, and mediation analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential mediating effects.\nResults: Overall, 7.64 % of participants exhibited depressive symptoms. MetS was associated with an increased risk of depression in both females (OR: 1.49, 95 % CI: 1.28-1.74) and males (OR: 1.32, 95 % CI: 1.09-1.60) after adjusting for confounders. Among MetS components, central obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia demonstrated the strongest associations with depression. Inflammatory markers mediated 26.79 % of the MetS-depression relationship, with CRP contributing the largest proportion (17.24 %).\nConclusion: MetS and its components significantly increase the risk of depressive symptoms, with the relationship partially mediated by inflammatory markers. Chronic inflammation may play a critical role in linking MetS to depression, underscoring the importance of integrated management strategies targeting both metabolic and mental health."

    "abstract": "Dysregulated lipid metabolism is linked to tumor progression. In this study, we identified Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) as a downstream effector of PKM2. In breast cancer cells, PKM2 knockout (KO) enhanced NPC1L1 expression while downregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) signaling pathway. PPARα and nuclear factor-E2 p45-related factor 1/2(Nrf1/2) are transcription factors regulating NPC1L1. In vitro PKM2 KO enhanced recruitment of Nrf1/2 to the NPC1L1 promoter region. Fenofibrate, a PPARα activator, promoted NPC1L1 expression; ezetimibe, an NPC1L1 inhibitor and effective Nrf2 activator, also elevated NPC1L1 expression. Combined administration of fenofibrate and ezetimibe significantly induced cytoplasmic vacuolation, and cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, this combined administration activated inositol required enzyme 1α(IRE1α) and produced the spliced form of X-box binding protein (XBP1s), which in turn enhanced lysine demethylase 6B (KDM6B) transcription. XBP1s interacts with KDM6B to activate genes involved in the unfolded protein response by demethylating di- and tri-methylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27), consequently increasing H3K27 acetylation levels in breast cancer cell lines. Fenofibrate and ezetimibe synergistically inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Our findings reveal that dual targeting of PPARα and NPC1L1 may represent a novel therapeutic regimen for breast cancer therapy."

FUS-mutation-associated ALS (FUS-ALS) is characterised by early onset and rapid progression, compared with other forms of ALS. However, different pathogenic mutations in FUS can result in markedly different age at symptom onset and rate of disease progression. Most FUS mutations disrupt its nuclear localisation, leading to its cytoplasmic accumulation in the CNS. FUS also forms inclusions in around 5% of patients with the related neurodegenerative condition frontotemporal dementia. However, there are key differences between the two diseases at the genetic and neuropathological level, which suggest distinct pathogenic processes. Experimental models have uncovered potential pathogenic mechanisms in FUS-ALS and informed therapeutic strategies that are currently in development, including the silencing of FUS expression using an intrathecally administered antisense oligonucleotide."

    "abstract": "Background: People with subclinical atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of stroke, albeit to a lesser extent than those with clinical atrial fibrillation, leading to an ongoing debate regarding the benefit of anticoagulation in these individuals. In the ARTESiA trial, the direct-acting oral anticoagulant apixaban reduced stroke or systemic embolism compared with aspirin in people with subclinical atrial fibrillation, but the risk of major bleeding was increased with apixaban. In a prespecified subgroup analysis of ARTESiA, we tested the hypothesis that people with subclinical atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, who are known to have an increased risk of recurrent stroke, would show a greater benefit from oral anticoagulation for secondary stroke prevention compared with those without a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.\nMethods: ARTESiA is a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised controlled trial conducted at 247 sites in 16 countries across Europe and North America. Adults aged 55 years or older with device-detected subclinical atrial fibrillation lasting from 6 min to 24 h and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3 or higher were randomly assigned using an interactive web-based system to oral apixaban 5 mg twice per day or oral aspirin 81 mg once per day. The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or systemic embolism, and the primary safety outcome was major bleeding, assessed as absolute risk differences. Analyses were by intention to treat. ARTESiA is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01938248) and is completed; this report presents a prespecified subgroup analysis in people with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.\nFindings: Between May 7, 2015, and July 30, 2021, 4012 people with subclinical atrial fibrillation were randomly allocated either apixaban (n=2015) or aspirin (n=1997). A history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack was present in 346 (8·6%) participants (172 assigned to apixaban and 174 to aspirin), among whom the annual rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 1·20% (n=7; 95% CI 0·48 to 2·48) with apixaban versus 3·14% (n=18; 1·86 to 4·96) with aspirin; (hazard ratio [HR] 0·40, 95% CI 0·17 to 0·95). In participants without a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (n=3666; 1843 assigned to apixaban and 1823 to aspirin), the annual rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 0·74% (n=48; 95% CI 0·55 to 0·98) with apixaban versus 1·07% (n=68; 95% CI 0·83 to 1·36) with aspirin (HR 0·69, 95% CI 0·48 to 1·00). The absolute risk difference in incidence of stroke or systemic embolism at 3·5 years of follow-up was 7% (95% CI 2 to 12) in participants with versus 1% (0 to 3) in participants without a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. The annual rate of major bleeding in participants with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack was 2·26% with apixaban (n=13; 95% CI 1·21 to 3·87) versus 1·16% with aspirin (n=7; 0·47 to 2·39; HR 1·94, 95% CI 0·77 to 4·87). The absolute risk difference in major bleeding events at 3·5 years was 3% (-1 to 8) in individuals with a versus 1% (-1 to 2) in those without a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.\nInterpretation: Treatment with the direct-acting oral anticoagulant apixaban in people with subclinical atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack led to a 7% absolute risk reduction in stroke or systemic embolism over 3·5 years, compared with a 1% absolute risk reduction for individuals without a previous history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. The corresponding absolute increase in major bleeding was 3% and 1%, respectively. Apixaban could be considered for secondary stroke prevention in people with subclinical atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.\nFunding: The Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance, Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, Canadian Stroke Prevention and Intervention Network, Hamilton Health Sciences, Accelerating Clinical Trials Network, Population Health Research Institute, and Medtronic."

    "abstract": "Background: No treatments exist for apathy in people with frontotemporal dementia. Previously, in a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study, intranasal oxytocin administration in people with frontotemporal dementia improved apathy ratings on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory over 1 week and, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, a single dose of 72 IU oxytocin increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal in limbic brain regions. We aimed to determine whether longer treatment with oxytocin improves apathy in people with frontotemporal dementia.\nMethods: We conducted a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive, crossover, phase 2a/2b trial, enrolling participants from 11 expert frontotemporal dementia outpatient clinics across Canada and the USA. People aged 30-80 years with a diagnosis of probable frontotemporal dementia, a Neuropsychiatric Inventory apathy score of 2 or higher, a study partner who interacted with them for at least 3 h per day, and stable cognitive and behavioural medications for 30 days were eligible for inclusion. In stage 1, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to one of three dose schedules (every day, every other day, and every third day) of 72 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo and to the order they would received the intervention in the crossover; intranasal oxytocin or placebo were administered twice daily for 6 weeks, with a 6-week washout and then crossover to the other intervention. In stage 2, new participants were randomised (1:1) to the dose that had been determined as optimal in stage 1 or to placebo, with crossover as in stage 1. Randomisation used variable block sizes and was stratified by participant sex and Clinical Dementia Rating severity score. All kits of investigational product were identical and produced centrally, and all local teams, study staff, and participants were masked to treatment allocation and order. The primary outcome was difference in the change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory apathy scores for oxytocin versus placebo periods in the per-protocol population after 6 weeks of treatment. Safety was assessed at each visit via electrocardiogram, blood work, and collection of data on adverse events. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03260920).\nFindings: Between Jan 31, 2018, and Dec 11, 2020, 70 patients were screened for stage 1 and 60 (86%) were enrolled. 45 (75%) completed both treatment periods of stage 1. 72 IU oxytocin every third day was the optimal dose schedule from stage 1 based on its Bayesian posterior probability (Pr(Best)=0·478). Between June 28, 2021, and Jan 31, 2023, 42 patients were screened for stage 2, and 34 (81%) were enrolled. 28 (82%) completed both treatment periods in stage 2. 38 (40%) of 94 participants were female and 56 (60%) were male (mean age 65·9 years, SD 8·2) Treatment with oxytocin every third day resulted in an improved Neuropsychiatric Inventory apathy score, with an estimated -1·32 points (95% CI -2·43 to -0·21) relative to placebo (one sided p=0·010). Two adverse events were reported in at least 5% of participants: upper respiratory tract infection (five [6%] of 78 participants on placebo and three [5%] on every third day at all doses of oxytocin) and headache (two [3%] participants on placebo, one [7%] of 15 participants on oxytocin every day, and two [4%] of 55 participants on oxytocin every third day). No adverse events were attributed to oxytocin treatment.\nInterpretation: Intranasal oxytocin given every third day was well tolerated and was associated with a small reduction in apathy in patients with frontotemporal dementia. Future trials might investigate intermittent dosing of more potent formulations than in this study, to establish whether larger effects are possible.\nFunding: Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Weston Foundation."

    "abstract": "Background: Evidence from preclinical studies suggests that IL-6 signalling has the potential to modulate immunopathogenic mechanisms upstream of autoantibody effector mechanisms in patients with generalised myasthenia gravis. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of satralizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor, in patients with generalised myasthenia gravis.\nMethods: LUMINESCE was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase 3 study at 105 sites, including hospitals and clinics, globally. Eligible patients were aged 12 years and older, with seropositive generalised myasthenia gravis (autoantibodies to the acetylcholine receptor [AChR-IgG], muscle-specific kinase [MuSK-IgG], or low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 [LRP4-IgG]), a Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America severity class II-IV, a Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score of 5 or more (non-ocular contribution >50%), and use of stable background therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a permuted-block randomisation method to receive subcutaneous satralizumab (120 mg for bodyweight ≤100 kg; 180 mg for bodyweight >100 kg) or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter until week 24. Randomisation was stratified according to background therapy, autoantibody type, and geographical region. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change from baseline in total MG-ADL score at week 24 in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomised AChR-IgG-positive patients who completed at least one post-baseline MG-ADL assessment). Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The open-label extension was terminated early because of the sponsor's decision to halt further development of satralizumab for treatment of generalised myasthenia gravis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04963270, and EudraCT, 2020-004436-21.\nFindings: Between Oct 19, 2021, and Aug 15, 2023, 188 patients were randomly assigned to satralizumab (n=96) or placebo (n=92). 166 AChR-IgG-positive patients (80 in the placebo group and 86 in the satralizumab group) were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. At week 24, statistically significant yet small improvements in MG-ADL score were observed with satralizumab versus placebo (adjusted mean -3·59, 95% CI -4·15 to -3·02 vs -2·57, -3·25 to -1·88; difference -1·02, -1·88 to -0·16; p=0·0120). The proportion of patients with at least one adverse event during the double-blind period was slightly higher in patients treated with satralizumab compared with patients treated with placebo (86 [90%] patients vs 67 [73%] patients). Three serious adverse events (in three [3%] patients) were reported in the satralizumab group (pneumonia, pyelonephritis, and increased lipase) compared with nine (in six [7%] patients) serious adverse events in the placebo group (COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, bacterial urinary tract infection, chest pain, back pain, and rosacea). There were no deaths or adverse events of special interest.\nInterpretation: Satralizumab was well tolerated and resulted in small improvements in patient-reported and clinician-reported outcomes compared with placebo at week 24 in patients with AChR-IgG-positive generalised myasthenia gravis. Further research analysing the immunological underpinnings of the observed clinical response to IL-6 signalling inhibition in patients with generalised myasthenia gravis and exploring the role of IL-6 in autoantibody-mediated diseases is warranted.\nFunding: F Hoffmann La Roche."

    "abstract": "Background: Given burdensome side-effects and long latency for efficacy with conventional agents, there is a continued need for generalised myasthenia gravis treatments that are safe and provide consistently sustained, long-term disease control. Nipocalimab, a neonatal Fc receptor blocker, was associated with dose-dependent reductions in total IgG and anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies and clinically meaningful improvements in the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scale in patients with generalised myasthenia gravis in a phase 2 study. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of nipocalimab in a phase 3 study.\nMethods: Vivacity-MG3 was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study conducted at 81 outpatient centres with expertise in myasthenia gravis in 17 countries in Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with generalised myasthenia gravis inadequately controlled with standard-of-care therapy (MG-ADL score ≥6) were randomly assigned (1:1) to either nipocalimab (30 mg/kg loading dose then 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks for maintenance dosing) or placebo infusions every 2 weeks, added to standard-of-care therapy in both groups, for 24 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by antibody status, day 1 MG-ADL total score, and region. The sponsor, investigators, clinical raters, and participants were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the difference between nipocalimab and placebo based on least-squares mean change from baseline in MG-ADL total score averaged over weeks 22, 23, and 24 in the intention-to-treat population of patients who were antibody-positive (for AChR, anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase [MuSK], or anti-low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 [LRP4]). Adverse events were assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04951622; the double-blind phase is completed and an open-label extension phase is ongoing.\nFindings: Between July 15, 2021, and Nov 17, 2023, 199 patients were enrolled, and 196 patients received study drug (98 in the nipocalimab group and 98 in the placebo group); of these, 153 (77 in the nipocalimab group and 76 in the placebo group) were antibody-positive. The least-squares mean change in MG-ADL score from baseline to weeks 22, 23, and 24 was -4·70 (SE 0·329) in the nipocalimab group versus -3·25 (0·335) in the placebo group (difference -1·45 [95% CI -2·38 to -0·52]; p=0·0024). The incidence of adverse events was similar between groups (82 [84%] of 98 in both the nipocalimab and placebo groups), including infections (42 [43%] of 98 in the nipocalimab group and placebo group) and headache (14 [14%] of 98 in the nipocalimab group and 17 [17%] of 98 in the placebo group). Serious adverse events were reported for nine (9%) of 98 patients in the nipocalimab group and 14 (14%) of 98 patients in the placebo group, three of which had a fatal outcome (nipocalimab: myasthenic crisis; placebo: cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction).\nInterpretation: Results from the completed double-blind phase of Vivacity-MG3 support the role of nipocalimab, added to standard-of-care therapies, as a safe treatment for sustained disease control over 6 months for a broad population of patients with generalised myasthenia gravis who are antibody-positive. The ongoing open-label extension phase should provide longer term sustained safety and efficacy data with nipocalimab.\nFunding: Janssen Research & Development, LLC, a Johnson & Johnson company."

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier is a physiological barrier that can prevent both small and complex drugs from reaching the brain to exert a pharmacological effect. For treatment of neurological diseases, drug concentrations at the target site are a fundamental parameter for therapeutic effect; thus, the blood-brain barrier is a major obstacle to overcome. Novel strategies have been developed to circumvent the blood-brain barrier, including CSF delivery, intracranial delivery, ultrasound-based methods, membrane transporters, receptor-mediated transcytosis, and nanotherapeutics. These approaches each have their advantages and disadvantages. CSF delivery and intracranial delivery are direct but invasive techniques that have not yet shown efficacy in clinical trials, although development of novel delivery devices might improve these approaches. Ultrasound-based disruption has shown some efficacy in clinical trials, but it can require invasive procedures. Approaches using membrane transporters and receptor-mediated transcytosis are less invasive than are other techniques, but they can have off-target effects. Nanotherapeutics have shown promise, but these strategies are in early stages of development. Advancements in drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier will require appropriately designed and powered clinical studies, with a focus on the timing of treatment, demographic and genetic considerations, head-to-head comparison with other treatment strategies (rather than a placebo), and relevant primary and secondary outcome measures."

    "abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by painful, deep-seated nodules, abscesses, and draining tunnels in the skin of axillary, inguinal, genitoanal, or inframammary areas. In recent years, the body of knowledge in hidradenitis suppurativa has advanced greatly. This disorder typically starts in the second or third decade of life. The average worldwide prevalence is 1% but varies geographically. Hidradenitis suppurativa has a profound negative effect on patients' quality of life and on the gross value added to society. Comorbidities (eg, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease) frequently accompany skin alterations, because of systemic inflammation. Pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa is complex and includes innate immune mechanisms (eg, macrophages, neutrophils, IL-1β, tumour necrosis factor [TNF], and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), T-cell mechanisms (eg, IL-17 and IFN-γ), and B-cell mechanisms (eg, associated with dermal tertiary lymphatic structures and autoantibodies). Chronic inflammation leads to irreversible skin damage with tunnel formation and morbid scarring. Current treatment includes drug therapy (for the initial, purely inflammatory phase), combined drug and surgical therapy (for the destructive phase), or surgery alone (for the burnout phase). The first systemic therapies approved for hidradenitis suppurativa targeting TNF (adalimumab) and IL-17 (secukinumab and bimekizumab) have expanded drug therapy options for moderate-to-severe disease, which were previously mainly restricted to oral antibiotics. Moreover, there is a robust pipeline of immunomodulatory drugs in various stages of development for hidradenitis suppurativa. Aims of management should include early intervention to prevent irreversible skin damage, adequate control of symptoms including pain, and mitigation of extra-cutaneous comorbidities, all requiring early diagnosis and an interdisciplinary, holistic and personalised approach."

    "abstract": "Ketone bodies generated in hepatocytes in the adult liver are used for nonhepatic tissues as an energy source. However, ketolysis is reactivated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells with largely unelucidated mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1 (OXCT1), a rate-limiting enzyme in ketolysis, interacts with SUCLA2 upon IGF1 stimulation in HCC cells. This interaction results from ERK2-mediated SUCLA2 S124 phosphorylation and subsequent PIN1-mediated cis-trans isomerization of SUCLA2. OXCT1-associated SUCLA2 generates succinyl-CoA, which not only serves as a substrate for OXCT1 but also directly succinylates OXCT1 at K421 and activates OXCT1. SUCLA2-regulated OXCT1 activation substantially enhances ketolysis, HCC cell proliferation, and tumor growth in mice. Notably, treatment with acetohydroxamic acid, an OXCT1 inhibitor used clinically for urinary infection, inhibits liver tumor growth in mice and significantly enhances lenvatinib therapy. Our findings highlight the role of SUCLA2-coupled regulation of OXCT1 succinylation in ketolysis and unveil an unprecedented strategy for treating HCC by interrupting ketolysis."

    "abstract": "Synaptic dysfunction is a primary hallmark of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, leading to cognitive and behavioral decline. While alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid, and tau are involved in the physiological functioning of synapses, their pathological aggregation has been linked to synaptopathology. The methodology for studying the small-soluble protein aggregates formed by these proteins is limited. Here we describe SynPull, a method combining single-molecule pull-down, super-resolution microscopy, and advanced computational analyses to characterize the protein aggregates in human and mouse synaptosomes. We show that AT8-positive tau aggregates are the predominant aggregate type in synaptosomes from postmortem Alzheimer's disease brain, although the aggregate size does not change in disease. Meanwhile, the relatively smaller amount of alpha-synuclein and beta-amyloid aggregates found in the synapses are larger than the extra-synaptic ones. Collectively, these results show the utility of SynPull to study pathological aggregates in neurodegeneration, elucidating the disease mechanisms causing synaptic dysfunction."

A population of recruited lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) has been reported to populate the diseased liver alongside resident Kupffer cells (KCs). However, the precise roles of these distinct macrophage subsets remain elusive. Here, using proteogenomics, we have identified LAMs in multiple models of liver injury. Moreover, we found that this phenotype is not specific to recruited macrophages, as a subset of resident KCs can also adopt a LAM-like phenotype in the mouse and human liver. By combining genetic mouse models targeting the distinct populations, we determined that both recruited LAMs and resident LAM-like KCs play crucial roles in tissue repair. Specifically, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) expression on either resident or recruited macrophages is required for the efficient clearance of dying cells, enhancing repair and preventing exacerbated fibrosis."

We employed a functional genomic approach using the Lazy Piggy transposon to identify tumor maintenance genes in vivo and applied this to sonic hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastoma (MB). Combining Lazy Piggy screening in mice and transcriptomic profiling of human MB, we identified the voltage-gated potassium channel KCNB2 as a candidate maintenance driver. KCNB2 governs cell volume of MB-propagating cells (MPCs), with KCNB2 depletion causing osmotic swelling, decreased plasma membrane tension, and elevated endocytic internalization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), thereby mitigating proliferation of MPCs to ultimately impair MB growth. KCNB2 is largely dispensable for mouse development and KCNB2 knockout synergizes with anti-SHH therapy in treating MB. These results demonstrate the utility of the Lazy Piggy functional genomic approach in identifying cancer maintenance drivers and elucidate a mechanism by which potassium homeostasis integrates biomechanical and biochemical signaling to promote MB aggression."

    "abstract": "Cigarette smoke (CS), an indoor environmental pollution, is an environmental risk factor for diverse neurological disorders. However, the neurotoxicological effects and mechanisms of CS on Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression remain unclear. We found that CS accelerated the progression of AD, including increasing β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque deposition and exacerbating cognitive decline. Mechanistically, CS exposure increased the levels of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), which impaired autophagic flux in microglia by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal. Metabolomics analysis revealed an upregulation of lactate levels and an increase in global protein lysine lactylation in the brain tissue of CS-exposed AD-transgenic mice. Immunoprecipitation-Mass Spectrometry and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that CS elevates H4K12 lactylation (H4K12la) levels, which accumulate at the promoter region of NLRP3, leading to the activation of its transcription. Via inhibiting lactate or NLRP3 activation, oxamate and MCC950 alleviates these CS-induced effects. Therefore, our data suggest that the CS-induced increase in lactate levels triggers NLRP3 transcriptional activation through H4K12la, which subsequently leads to mTOR-mediated autophagy dysfunction in microglia, promoting microglial activation and resulting in Aβ plaque accumulation in AD-transgenic mice. This provides a new mechanism and potential therapeutic target for AD associated with environmental factors."

    "abstract": "In situ bone regeneration and vertical bone augmentation have been huge problems in clinical practice, always imposing a significant economic burden and causing patient suffering. Herein, MgZnYNd magnesium alloy rod implantation in mouse femur resulted in substantial subperiosteal new bone formation, with osteoimmunomodulation playing a pivotal role. Abundant macrophages were attracted to the subperiosteal new bone region and proved to be the most important regulation cells for bone regeneration. Periosteum stripping, macrophage depletion, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) blockade effectively diminished the MgZnYNd alloy-induced subperiosteal osteogenesis. Mechanistically, the degradation products of MgZnYNd alloy promoted M2 macrophage polarization and the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which enhanced periosteum-derived stem cells (PDSCs) osteogenesis through the JAK1-STAT3 pathway. An anti-IL-10 neutralizing antibody or STAT3 inhibitor significantly inhibited M2 macrophage-mediated osteogenic differentiation of PDSCs. Transcriptomics and proteomics revealed that periostin is the core regulator of PDSCs osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, a novel clinical translation application of Mg-induced subperiosteal osteogenesis was developed, demonstrating its ability to preserve the height and width of the alveolar crest in rats and rabbits following tooth extraction. Collectively, these findings unveil a previously undefined role for Mg alloy-induced subperiosteal osteogenesis via macrophage-mediated osteoimmunomodulation, suggesting the therapeutic potential of magnesium alloy in bone regeneration and bone augmentation."

Due to its proximity to the upper limit of tolerability, dose adjustments are often necessary to manage potential adverse reactions resulting from its pharmacokinetic (PK) variability.\nMethods: Population PK studies of erlotinib were identified using PubMed databases. Simulations of erlotinib concentrations were conducted at 4-h intervals, with covariate simulations based on patient characteristics.\nResults: Three studies were included in this analysis. The one-compartment model was determined to be the most suitable for describing the population PK of erlotinib. A decrease in clearance was observed with age, while an increase in clearance was noted in smoking patients. The volume of distribution was positively correlated with body weight. Our study proposes optimal dosing of erlotinib based on age and smoking status, categorizing the patient population into six groups.\nConclusion: This is the first report on a model-based meta-analysis approach to develop a population PK model of erlotinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Our findings suggest that an increased dosage is appropriate for patients under 60 who smoke, whereas a reduced dosage is more suitable for non-smoking older patients."

Even in groups with lower kidney function, the drug retention rate was maintained (adjusted hazard ratio was 1.14 (95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.62), p= 0.45). Patients had a decreased DAS28-CRP (p< 0.01) and a reduced prednisolone dosage (p< 0.01) over the six-month period following tsDMARD initiation. The incidence of herpes zoster and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was higher in the group with an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, but not statistically significant.\nConclusions: tsDMARDs have demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with RA and CKD; however, clinicians should consider the potential for herpes zoster and DVT in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2."

    "abstract": "Context: The efficacy of probiotics and diet management in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is controversial, and their relative effectiveness remains unclear.\nObjective: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics, diet management, and their combination on IBS.\nData sources: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched from inception to July 10, 2023, for relevant studies, including symptom relief, IBS-symptom severity score (-SSS), and IBS-quality of life measure (-QOL).\nData extraction: Two investigators independently performed the data extraction and quality assessment.\nData analysis: A network meta-analysis was performed using a frequentist approach and a random-effects model to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% CI.\nResults: Forty-four articles were eligible for this study. In relieving IBS symptoms, compared with a sham diet, a low-fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide, and polyols (low-FODMAP) diet (RR: 3.22; 95% CI: 1.70-6.26) and low-FODMAP diet combined with probiotics (RR: 17.79; 95% CI: 3.27-112.54) significantly relieved IBS symptoms. The control group showed significantly lower effectiveness than the probiotics group (RR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.32-0.69). According to the surface under the cumulative rank curve (SUCRA), a low-FODMAP diet combined with probiotics (80.4%) had the best effect in relieving IBS symptoms, followed by a low-FODMAP diet (70.8%), probiotics (65.1%), and a gluten-free diet (54.3%). In reducing the total IBS-SSS, the low-FODMAP diet (90.5%) was the most effective, followed by the low-FODMAP diet combined with probiotics (76.6%), probiotics alone (62.3%), and gluten-free diet (28.3%). In reducing total IBS-QOL, probiotics (72.1%) ranked first, followed by gluten-free (57.0%) and low-FODMAP (56.9%) diets. Probiotics (34.9%) were associated with the lowest risk of adverse effects.\nConclusion: A low-FODMAP diet combined with probiotics is most effective in relieving IBS symptoms. A low-FODMAP diet is the most recommended diet for alleviating IBS severity, and probiotics were associated with improving the QOL of patients with IBS, with the fewest adverse events.\nSystematic review registration: PROSPERO registration no.

This narrative review examines the role of nutritional therapy in the prevention and management of malnutrition in COPD, emphasizing evidence-based approaches and their clinical implications.\nRecent findings: COPD patients face increased metabolic demands, systemic inflammation, and reduced dietary intake, resulting in muscle wasting, sarcopenia, and cachexia. Recent evidence highlights the efficacy of targeted nutritional strategies, including essential amino acid supplementation, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and antioxidants, in improving respiratory function, muscle strength, and patient well-being. Comprehensive nutritional assessments and personalized interventions are increasingly recognized as critical components of COPD care. However, long-term efficacy data remain limited. Nutritional therapy plays a pivotal role in managing malnutrition and improving clinical outcomes in COPD. This review synthesizes the latest evidence, identifies gaps in current research, and proposes strategies for integrating personalized nutrition into COPD care. Future studies are needed to establish the long-term benefits of these interventions and to develop tailored nutritional guidelines for COPD patients."

    "abstract": "Background: Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the benefits of atrial fibrillation (AF) screening. However, since none have shown a significant reduction in stroke rates, the impact of screening on clinical outcomes remains uncertain.\nMaterials and methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs reporting clinical outcomes of systematic AF screening in participants without known AF. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) were computed for all-cause stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality, comparing screening with no screening.\nResults: Seven RCTs encompassing 76 458 participants were identified. One trial utilized implantable loop recorders for rhythm monitoring, while the others employed non-invasive screening methods. Pooled results indicated that AF screening was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause stroke or systemic embolism (RR 0.932, 95% CI 0.873-0.996, I2 = 0%, p = 0.037), but had no effect on major bleeding (RR 0.996, 95% CI 0.935-1.060, I2 = 0%, p = 0.876) or all-cause mortality (RR 0.987, 95% CI 0.945-1.031, I2 = 0%, p = 0.550). We estimated a number needed to screen of 148 to prevent one stroke or systemic embolism over a 10-year period in a population of 75-year-olds. When only non-invasive screening methods were considered, the reduction in strokes was not statistically significant (RR 0.942, 95% CI 0.880-1.008, I2 = 0%, p = 0.083).\nConclusions: Systematic AF screening is associated with a modest yet statistically significant 7% relative reduction in stroke and systemic embolism, with no observed impact on major bleeding or all-cause mortality."

This study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and quality-of-life impact of tralokinumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-13 (IL-13), in treating moderate-to-severe AD in a real-world setting, with a focus on different AD phenotypes.\nMethods: An observational cohort of 30 adults treated with tralokinumab for ≥ 16 weeks was analyzed. Clinical and demographic data were collected, and outcomes were assessed using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and numeric rating scales (NRS) for pruritus and sleep disturbances.\nResults: By week 16, 60% achieved a 75% improvement in EASI (EASI75) and 31% reached a 90% improvement in EASI (EASI90), reflecting substantial clinical improvements. A ≥ 4-point reduction in pruritus NRS was observed in 63% of patients by week 16, increasing to 70% by week 32. Similarly, 75% achieved significant improvements in sleep disturbance NRS by week 16, with sustained effects through week 32. Subgroup analysis revealed superior clinical responses in patients with early-onset AD and atopic comorbidities. Lower total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels at week 16 correlated with better outcomes, suggesting total IgE as a potential biomarker. By week 32, 70% of patients had a DLQI ≤ 5, indicating minimal quality-of-life impact. Additionally, 88% reached at least one therapeutic target, and 81% met composite endpoints combining clinician-assessed and patient-reported outcomes. The safety profile was consistent with clinical trials, with mild conjunctivitis and injection site reactions as the most common adverse events.\nConclusion: These findings support tralokinumab as an effective and well-tolerated treatment, emphasizing the importance of phenotype-specific approaches in AD management."

Discontinuation periods (D1, D2, D3) were defined as the first month after T1, T2, and T3, respectively. The primary endpoint was the ≥ 50% response rate at D3 compared to D2. Secondary endpoints included changes in monthly migraine days (MMD), monthly headache days (MHD), monthly analgesic intake (MAI), numerical rating scale (NRS), Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6), ≥ 50% response rate at D3 versus D1 and D2, and relapse rates to CM or medication overuse.\nResults: At D3 vs. D2, significant improvements (p < 0.001) were observed in the ≥ 50% response rate (77.8% vs. 53.8%), MMD (- 2.1 ± 1.7), MHD (- 2.9 ± 2.4), MAI (- 2.6 ± 2.4), NRS (- 0.7 ± 1.3), and HIT-6 (- 7.2 ± 5.9), with lower relapse rates to CM (2.3% vs. 18%) and medication overuse (1.3% vs. 10.1%). Compared to D1, D3 demonstrated greater benefits (p < 0.001) in MMD (- 2.6 ± 1.9), MHD (- 5.8 ± 3.3), MAI (- 4.9 ± 3.4), NRS (- 1 ± 1.6), and HIT- 6 (- 9.4 ± 7), alongside higher ≥ 50% response rates (77.8% vs. 25%) and reduced relapses to CM (2.3% vs. 67.7%) and medication overuse (1.3% vs. 34.2%).\nDiscussion: Three years of anti-CGRP mAb treatment revealed a progressive increase in the proportion of ≥ 50% responders (D1: 25%; D2: 53.8%; D3: 77.8%) and substantial reductions in migraine burden, suggesting that prolonged treatment may favorably modify migraine course."

    "abstract": "Objective: One of the most severe endocrine side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is hypophysitis leading to adrenal insufficiency. Recovery is rare, although it has been reported after high-dose glucocorticoid treatment. This is the first randomised study to evaluate whether hormonal recovery differs in patients treated with high-dose glucocorticoids versus glucocorticoid replacement therapy.\nDesign/methods: In this single-centre, open, randomised controlled study, patients with ICI associated hypophysitis were randomised 1:1 to high-dose glucocorticoid treatment (1 mg/kg of prednisolone for two weeks, followed by tapering until week 7 and a switch to hydrocortisone 20 mg total daily dose in week 8) or glucocorticoid replacement therapy (hydrocortisone 20 mg total daily dose) over 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the frequency of hormonal axes recovery.\nResults: Between 17th April 2019 and 16th September 2022, 18 out of the 20 randomised patients finished the trial; eight completed high-dose, 10 glucocorticoid replacement. Nine patients presented with hyponatraemia, two had typical changes on MRI, 12 had isolated adrenal insufficiency, and six had an additional hormone deficiency. None of the patients in neither group experienced a recovery in adrenal function. One patient in each group showed amelioration of hypogonadism. There was a significant, unfavourable treatment effect of high-dose treatment on HbA1c (mean treatment effect 5.16, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 10.02, p = 0.039).\nConclusions: High-dose glucocorticoid treatment was not effective in restoring adrenal function and leads to adverse effects on glucose metabolism. We therefore do not recommend its use for the treatment of ICI associated hypophysitis, except for compressive symptoms."

    "abstract": "Background: Overexpression of interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F significantly influences psoriasis pathology. Until recently, biologics targeting IL-17A alone, like secukinumab, were used to treat psoriasis. Bimekizumab is a monoclonal IgG1 antibody that targets both IL-17A and IL-17F. BE RADIANT was the first phase 3 study to investigate switching from selective inhibition of IL-17A to dual inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17F.Bimekizumab has previously shown superior achievement of complete skin clearance (PASI 100) versus secukinumab through 48 weeks. Switching from secukinumab to bimekizumab resulted in improved clinical responses. Over 2 years, no new safety signals were observed.\nObjective: To report 3-year efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis receiving continuous bimekizumab, or switching from secukinumab after 1 year.\nMethods: The BE RADIANT phase 3b randomised controlled trial had a 48-week double-blinded period, in which patients received bimekizumab (320 mg every 4 weeks [Q4W]), or secukinumab (300 mg weekly to Week 4, then Q4W). At Week 16, bimekizumab-randomised patients underwent re-randomisation to receive Q4W or Q8W maintenance dosing. From Week 48 onwards (open-label extension), all received bimekizumab.\nResults: 336 bimekizumab- and 318 baseline secukinumab-randomised patients entered the open-label extension. Among these, more bimekizumab-randomised patients achieved PASI 100 (modified non-responder imputation) at Year 1 (74.9%) versus secukinumab-randomised patients (52.8%). PASI 100 response rates were maintained over 3 years in bimekizumab-treated patients (68.8%) and increased in secukinumab-randomised patients switching to bimekizumab (68.8%).Bimekizumab was well-tolerated to 3 years. In patients receiving ≥1 bimekizumab dose, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) over 3 years were nasopharyngitis, oral candidiasis, and upper respiratory tract infection (exposure adjusted incidence rates: 12.2, 10.0, and 5.5/100 patient-years, respectively). Rates of TEAEs of interest, including serious infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and suicidal ideation and behaviour, did not increase with longer exposure to bimekizumab from 1 to 3 years.\nConclusion: Over two-thirds of bimekizumab-randomised patients and those switching from secukinumab to bimekizumab achieved and maintained complete skin clearance over 3 years of treatment. Over 3 years, bimekizumab was well-tolerated, and TEAE rates did not increase with longer exposure."

    "abstract": "Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a re-emerging respiratory pathogen causing significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. First identified in 2001, HMPV has since been recognised as a leading cause of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) worldwide. Its transmission occurs through droplets, direct contact, and surface contamination, with crowded spaces and healthcare facilities serving as key environmental amplifiers. HMPV's clinical manifestations, ranging from mild cold-like symptoms to severe pneumonia, often overlap with those of other respiratory pathogens like RSV and COVID-19, complicating timely diagnosis and management. Despite advancements in molecular diagnostics, the limited accessibility of these tools in low-resource settings presents a challenge. Preventive measures, such as hygiene practices and physical distancing, remain critical, as no approved vaccines or targeted antiviral therapies are currently available. However, promising innovations, including AI-guided vaccine design and portable diagnostic tools, highlight the potential for future breakthroughs. This article highlights the urgent need for enhanced surveillance, scalable diagnostics, and intensified research into vaccines and therapeutic strategies. By addressing these gaps, HMPV's global burden can be significantly mitigated, improving outcomes for high-risk populations, and strengthening preparedness against respiratory virus outbreaks."

We developed pharmacodynamic and covariate models for different administration routes, using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate efficacy distribution. Dropout and adverse event-related dropout rates were analyzed via single-arm meta-analysis.\nResults: Involving 22 studies with 56 treatment arms and 3,059 patients, our findings suggest combination therapies outperform monotherapy, achieving an additional 6.5% reduction in MADRS scores over 12 weeks. The most effective combinations were olanzapine with fluoxetine and quetiapine with SSRIs/SNRIs. Injectable treatments, particularly ayahuasca, produced rapid effects, with a 77% reduction in MADRS scores at 15 days. Intranasal treatments reached efficacy sooner than oral ones, with 28-day efficacy similar to the 12-week efficacy of the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination. Dropout rates due to adverse events were similar across methods (4.5%-5.2%), but total dropouts were highest for oral (17.9%) and lowest for intranasal routes (10.6%). Additionally, there was considerable variation in the incidence of headache, dizziness, and nausea across different administration routes.\nConclusion: The quantitative evaluation of 22 TRD treatments illuminates key pharmacodynamic parameters, bolstering the development of clinical guidelines and aiding the design of clinical trials and medical decision-making."

    "abstract": "Background: Thyroid Hormones (THs) critically impact human cancer. Although endowed with both tumor-promoting and inhibiting effects in different cancer types, excess of THs has been linked to enhanced tumor growth and progression. Breast cancer depends on the interaction between bulk tumor cells and the surrounding microenvironment in which mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exert powerful pro-tumorigenic activities.\nMethods: Primary human MSCs from healthy female donors were co-cultured with DIO2 knock out (D2KO) and wild type (WT) MCF7 breast cancer cells to assess cell growth, migration, invasion and the expression of known epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)- and inflammation-related markers. Furthermore, a surgery-free intraductal delivery model, i.e., the Mouse-INtraDuctal (MIND) injection method, was used as a tool for in vivo characterization of breast tumor formation and progression.\nResults: In this study, we uncovered a novel role of THs in regulating the tumor-stroma crosstalk. MCF7 cells enhanced the intracellular activation of THs through the TH-activating enzyme, D2, fostering their EMT properties and the dialogue with MSCs. D2 inactivation reduced the invasiveness of MCF7 cells and their responsiveness to the pro-tumorigenic induction via MSCs, both in vivo and in vitro.\nConclusions: Thus, we argue that intracellular activation of THs via D2 is a critical requirement for invasive and metastatic conversion of breast cancer cells, advising the blocking of D2 as a potential therapeutic tool for cancer therapy."

    "abstract": "Background: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) and its related vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may play a significant role in atherosclerosis and their targeting is a strategic approach that may affect multiple pathways influencing disease progression. This study aimed to perform a systematic review to reveal current evidence on the role of HIF-1α and VEGF immunophenotypes with other prognostic markers as potential biomarkers of atherosclerosis prognosis and treatment efficacy.\nMethods: We performed a systematic review of the current literature to explore the role of HIF-1α and VEGF protein expression along with the relation to the prognosis and therapeutic strategies of atherosclerosis. We used the terms {\"Atherosclerosis\" [OR] \"Atheroma\" [OR] \"atheromatous plaque\" [OR] \"plaque atherosclerotic\"} [AND] {\"HIF-1α\"} [AND] {\"VEGF\"} from 2009 up to May 2024 and the Medline/Embase/PubMed database. We used methodological approaches to assess unbiased data [ROBIS (Risk of Bias in Systematic) tool]. We used study eligibility criteria, and data were collected and evaluated from original articles by two independent teams, judged by an independent reviewer, and reported by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020.\nResults: We included 34 original studies investigating 650 human specimens, 21 different cell lines, and 9 animal models. Increased HIF-1α in vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages, or endothelial cells, under hypoxia, chronic loss of nitric oxide (NO), or reduced micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA)-17 and miR-20, is associated with the upregulation of pro-inflammatory molecules, such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), increased migration inhibitory factor of macrophages, glycolytic flux, lipid accumulation, necroptosis via miR-383, and adverse effects in atherosclerosis and plaque vulnerability. However, increased HIF-1α in lymphocytes is associated with decreased interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and a favorable prognosis. Increased VEGF in a coronary artery, activated macrophages, or chronic exposure to methamphetamine is associated with elevated levels of serum inflammatory cells (interleukin-18; IL18), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor (LITAF), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 isoform B (STAT6B) overexpression, leading to atherosclerosis progression and plaque break. However, VEGF overexpression in serum is marginally associated with an elevated risk for atherosclerosis. In contrast, stable overexpression of VEGF in macrophages correlates with reduced hyperplasia after arterial injury, reduced foam cell formation, and attenuation of atherosclerosis progression. HIF-1α/VEGF immunophenotypes reflect atherosclerosis treatment efficacy using, among others, HIF-inhibitors, statins, polyphenols, miR-497-5p, methylation modification, adenosine receptor antagonists, natural products, or glycosides.\nConclusion: We present an overview of HIF-1α/VEGF expression in chronic inflammatory-related atherosclerosis disease. Exploring pathogenetic mechanisms and therapeutic options, we included several studies using variable methods to evaluate HIF-1α/VEGF immunophenotypes with controversial and innovative results. Data limitations may include the use of different survival methods. Our data support HIF-1α/VEGF immunophenotypes as potential biomarkers of atherosclerosis prognosis and treatment efficacy."

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder marked by neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neuronal damage. Recent advancements highlight a novel interaction between iron-dependent cell death, known as ferroptosis, and gut microbiota, which may significantly influences the pathophysiology of MS. Ferroptosis, driven by lipid peroxidation and tightly linked to iron metabolism, is a pivotal contributor to the oxidative stress observed in MS. Concurrently, the gut microbiota, known to affect systemic immunity and neurological health, emerges as an important regulator of iron homeostasis and inflammatory responses, thereby influencing ferroptotic pathways. This review investigates how gut microbiota dysbiosis and ferroptosis impact MS, emphasizing their potential as therapeutic targets. Through an integrated examination of mechanistic pathways and clinical evidence, we discuss how targeting these interactions could lead to novel interventions that not only modulate disease progression but also offer personalized treatment strategies based on gut microbiota profiling. This synthesis aims at deepening insights into the microbial contributions to ferroptosis and their implications in MS, setting the stage for future research and therapeutic exploration."

    "abstract": "Human skin is a physical and biochemical barrier that protects the internal body from the external environment. Throughout a person's life, the skin undergoes both intrinsic and extrinsic aging, leading to microscopic and macroscopic changes in its morphology. In addition, the repair processes slow with aging, making the older population more susceptible to skin diseases. Intrinsic factors associated with advanced age gradually degrade the dermal collagen matrix, resulting in fine wrinkles and reduced elasticity; this is accelerated in post-menopausal women due to estrogen deficiency. In contrast, extrinsic factors associated with advanced age, primarily caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, lead to coarse wrinkles, solar elastosis, hyperkeratosis, irregular pigmentation, and skin cancers. UVB radiation, while contributing to skin photo-aging, also induces the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D. Vitamin D, in turn, protects the skin from oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA damage, thereby delaying both chronological and photo-aging. Moreover, research has demonstrated an association between lower vitamin D levels and a higher prevalence of certain cutaneous diseases. This review explores and summarizes the critical role of vitamin D in skin aging and age-related skin diseases. The data presented highlight the importance of maintaining vitamin D adequacy throughout life."

The Comparison of Anticoagulation and anti-Platelet Therapies for Intracranial Vascular Atherostenosis (CAPTIVA) trial was designed to determine whether other combinations of dual antithrombotic therapy are superior to clopidogrel and aspirin.\nMethods: CAPTIVA is an ongoing, prospective, double-blinded, three-arm clinical trial at over 100 sites in the United States and Canada that will randomize 1683 high-risk subjects with a symptomatic infarct attributed to 70-99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery to 12 months of treatment with (1) ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose, then 90 mg twice daily), (2) low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily), or (3) clopidogrel (600 mg loading dose, then 75 mg daily). All subjects receive aspirin (81 mg daily), intensive risk factor management, and will undergo blinded CYP2C19 genotype analysis. The primary goal of the trial is to determine whether rivaroxaban or ticagrelor or both are superior to clopidogrel for lowering the primary endpoint (ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), or vascular death) within 12 months.

    "heading": "Immune Cell Characteristics and Infections Associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Asthma, and Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): A Mendelian Randomization Studies",
    "abstract": "Aims/Background Epidemiological studies indicate that the involvement of the immune system in the pathogenesis of infections associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and interstitial lung disease (ILD) remains unclear. This study aims to assess the potential causal link between infections associated with COPD, asthma, or ILD and immune system function. Methods We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets. The causal relationship between immune cell signaling and susceptibility to infections related to COPD, asthma, and ILD was evaluated using inverse variance weighting (IVW), Mendelian randomization (MR)-Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode approaches. To concurrently assess the causal impact of immune cell signaling on infection susceptibility associated with COPD, asthma, and ILD, a reverse Mendelian randomization analysis was also conducted. Results Genetic predisposition to elevated counts of circulating blood cells and their subpopulations demonstrated significant causal associations with a higher risk of COPD/asthma/ILD-related infections, as determined by IVW analysis. Specifically, genetically predicted increases in white blood cell count (odds ratio (OR) 1.08 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-1.11], p < 0.00001), neutrophil count (OR: 1.06 [95% CI: 1.02-1.10], p = 0.00190), lymphocyte count (OR: 1.04 [95% CI: 1.01-1.07], p = 0.01515), monocyte count (OR: 1.03 [95% CI: 1.01-1.06], p = 0.00440), and eosinophil count (OR: 1.07 [95% CI: 1.04-1.10], p = 0.00001) were causally correlated with an increased risk of these respiratory infections. Notably, four immunophenotypes were significantly associated with the risk of COPD/asthma/ILD-related infections: Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) DR+ NK% NK (OR: 0.98 [95% CI: 0.97-0.99], p = 0.0004), CD66b on CD66b++ myeloid cell (OR: 0.98 [95% CI: 0.97-0.99], p = 0.0007), HLA DR on CD14+ monocyte (OR: 1.03 [95% CI: 1.01-1.04], p = 0.0002), and HLA DR on CD33- HLA DR+ (OR: 1.03 [95% CI: 1.02-1.05], p < 0.00001). The causal effect of COPD/asthma/ILD-related infections on Immunoglobulin D (IgD) expression in IgD+ CD38br and transitional B cells was estimated to be 0.64 (95% CI: 0.49-0.83, p = 0.00091) and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.54-0.91, p = 0.00727), respectively. Additionally, COPD/asthma/ILD-related infections demonstrated a significant causal effect on several B cell and T cell subpopulations: IgD+ CD38- % B cells, IgD+ CD38- AC, CD4+ CD8dim AC, IgD+ CD38- % lymphocyte, and TD CD4+ AC, with the OR 1.54 (95% CI: 1.19-2.00, p = 0.00113), 1.56 (95% CI: 1.16-2.10, p = 0.00340), 1.60 (95% CI: 1.15-2.22, p = 0.00478), 1.47 (95% CI: 1.12-1.92, p = 0.00483) and 1.63 (95% CI: 1.14-2.34, p = 0.00725), respectively. Conclusion Our study reveals a causal association between altered circulating blood cell counts and specific immunophenotypes with the susceptibility to respiratory infections related to COPD, asthma, and ILD."

    "heading": "Exploring the Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options of Multiple Sclerosis",
    "abstract": "The complicated neurological syndrome known as multiple sclerosis (MS) is typified by demyelination, inflammation, and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Managing this crippling illness requires an understanding of the complex interactions between neurophysiological systems, diagnostic techniques, and therapeutic methods. A complex series of processes, including immunological dysregulation, inflammation, and neurodegeneration, are involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Gene predisposition, autoreactive T cells, B cells, and cytokines are essential participants in the development of the disease. Demyelination interferes with the ability of the CNS to transmit signals, which can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, including impaired motor function, sensory deficiencies, and cognitive decline. Developing tailored therapeutics requires understanding the underlying processes guiding the course of the disease. Neuroimaging, laboratory testing, and clinical examination are all necessary for an accurate MS diagnosis. Evoked potentials and cerebrospinal fluid studies assist in verifying the diagnosis, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for identifying distinctive lesions in the CNS. Novel biomarkers have the potential to increase diagnostic precision and forecast prognosis. The goals of MS treatment options are to control symptoms, lower disease activity, and enhance quality of life. To stop relapses and reduce the course of the disease, disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) target several components of the immune response. DMTs that are now on the market include interferons, glatiramer acetate, monoclonal antibodies, and oral immunomodulators; each has a unique mode of action and safety profile. Symptomatic treatments improve patients' general well-being by addressing specific symptoms, including pain, sphincter disorders, fatigue, and spasticity. Novel treatment targets, neuroprotective tactics, and personalized medicine techniques will be the main focus of MS research in the future. Improving long-term outcomes for MS patients and optimizing disease treatment may be possible by utilizing immunology, genetics, and neuroimaging developments. This study concludes by highlighting the complexity of multiple MS, including its changing therapeutic landscape, diagnostic problems, and neurophysiological foundations. A thorough grasp of these elements is essential to improving our capacity to identify, manage, and eventually overcome this intricate neurological condition."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Pancreatic cancer arising in the context of BRCA predisposition may benefit from poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. We analyzed real-world data on the impact of olaparib on survival in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients harboring germline BRCA mutations in Italy, where olaparib is not reimbursed for this indication.\nMethods: Clinico/pathological data of pancreatic cancer patients with documented BRCA1-2 germline pathogenic variants who had received first-line chemotherapy for metastatic disease were collected from 23 Italian oncology departments and the impact of olaparib exposure on overall survival (OS) was analyzed.\nResults: Of 114, 53 BRCA-mutant pancreatic cancer patients had received olaparib for metastatic disease. OS was significantly longer in patients who were exposed to olaparib (hazard ratio [HR] 0.568, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.351-0.918, log-rank p = 0.02) in any setting/line of treatment; similar results were obtained for patients who received olaparib as maintenance treatment (in any line of treatment), patients who had stage IV disease at diagnosis, and patients who did not experience progressive disease as their best response to first-line chemotherapy. Exposure to olaparib in the first-line maintenance setting after platinum-based chemotherapy, however, did not significantly impact survival. At multivariate analysis, CA19.9 levels at diagnosis and response to first-line chemotherapy were independently prognostic; however, when response to chemotherapy was excluded, any exposure to olaparib was a significant independent predictor of longer OS, together with CA19.9 levels.\nConclusion: The real-world data presented here support the use of olaparib for metastatic disease in germline BRCA-mutant pancreatic cancer patients, as it may significantly prolong survival."

A subset of 222 MS patients and 92 controls underwent 3T-MRI scan for brain atrophy and lesion analysis. Multinomial probabilistic models identified likelihood of belonging to cognitive phenotypes (\"preserved-cognition,\" \"mild verbal memory/semantic fluency,\" \"mild multi-domain,\" \"severe attention/executive,\" and \"severe multi-domain\") and experiencing MRI abnormalities based on disease duration and age at onset.\nResults: In all groups, the likelihood of \"preserved-cognition\" phenotype decreased, whereas \"mild multi-domain\" increased with longer disease duration. In pediatric- and adult-onset patients, the likelihood of \"mild verbal memory/semantic fluency\" phenotypes decreased with longer disease duration, and that of \"severe multi-domain\" increased with longer disease duration. Only in adult-onset patients, the likelihood of \"severe executive/attention\" phenotype increased with longer disease duration. All groups displayed escalating probabilities of cortical, thalamic, hippocampal, and deep gray matter atrophy over disease course. Compared to adult, pediatric-onset patients showed lower probability of experiencing thalamic atrophy with longer disease duration, while elderly-onset showed higher probability of experiencing cortical and hippocampal atrophy.\nInterpretation: Age at MS onset significantly influences the distribution of cognitive phenotypes and the patterns of regional gray matter atrophy throughout the disease course."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents an escalating global health crisis, constituting the leading cause of dementia among the elderly and profoundly impairing their quality of life. Current FDA-approved drugs, such as rivastigmine, donepezil, galantamine, and memantine, offer only modest symptomatic relief and are frequently associated with significant adverse effects. Faced with this challenge and in line with advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of this neurodegenerative condition, various innovative therapeutic strategies have been explored. Here, we review novel approaches inspired by advanced knowledge of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease. Among the therapeutic alternatives, immunotherapy stands out, employing monoclonal antibodies to specifically target and eliminate toxic proteins implicated in AD. Additionally, the use of medicinal plants is examined, as their synergistic effects among components may confer neuroprotective properties. The modulation of the gut microbiota is also addressed as a peripheral strategy that could influence neuroinflammatory and degenerative processes in the brain. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of emerging approaches, such as the use of microRNAs to regulate key cellular processes and nanotherapy, which enables precise drug delivery to the central nervous system, is analyzed. Despite promising advances in these strategies, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease continues to rise. Therefore, it is proposed that achieving effective treatment in the future may require the integration of combined approaches, maximizing the synergistic effects of different therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) is involved in the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines that mediate several chronic inflammatory disorders, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. In recent years, the therapeutic armamentarium in dermatology has expanded with the introduction of PDE4 inhibitors, both in oral and topical formulations. PDE4 inhibitors have gained increasing interest due to their remarkable safety record and ease of prescription, as evidenced by the recent influx of literature detailing its off-label uses. Apremilast was the first PDE4 inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and oral ulcers of Behcet's disease. Off-label use has been reported in diverse dermatological conditions, including aphthous stomatitis, chronic actinic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, cutaneous sarcoidosis, hidradenitis suppurativa, lichen planus, and discoid lupus erythematosus. Roflumilast is a PDE4 inhibitor that was approved by the FDA and the EMA as an oral treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Since patent expiration, several generic formulations of oral roflumilast have become available, and various studies have documented its off-label use in psoriasis and other dermatological conditions such as hidradenitis suppurativa, recurrent oral aphthosis, nummular eczema, lichen planus, and Behçet's disease. Topical roflumilast has received FDA approval for treatment of plaque psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. The favorable safety profile encourages its long-term use as an alternative to corticosteroids, addressing the chronic nature of many dermatological conditions. New oral PDE4 inhibitors are being developed, such as orismilast (LEO-32731), mufemilast (Hemay005), difamilast (OPA-15406) or lotamilast (E6005/RVT-501), among others. This narrative review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the pharmacology, clinical efficacy, safety profile, and practical considerations regarding the oral and topical use of PDE4 inhibitors in dermatology."

Recently, a gluten-free diet (GFD) has been proposed for non-celiac patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), but its usefulness is under debate. The present pilot study evaluates the effects of these two dietary regimes, with a focus on redox homeostasis, in HT.\nPatients and methods: 45 euthyroid HT patients (30 F; median age 42 years) were randomly assigned to different dietary regimes: MedD (n = 15), GFD (n = 15) and free diet (FD, n = 15). Thyroid function tests, autoantibodies, and oxidative stress markers (Advanced glycation end products, AGEs; glutathione peroxidase (GPx), thioredoxin reductase (TRxR), and total plasma antioxidant activity (TEAA) were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks.\nResults: In the MedD group, significantly lower values of AGEs and higher values of GPX, TRX and TEAA with anti-oxidant action were detected (p < 0.05) at 12 weeks compared to baseline, and compared to the GFD and FD groups, in which the oxidative stress parameters did not change significantly (p > 0.05). No significant differences in serum levels of TSH, FT4, Ab-Tg, Ab-TPO compared to baseline were found in any group.\nConclusions: This pilot study confirms the protective effect of the MedD against oxidative stress, while a GFD does not significantly influence markers of oxidative stress and/or thyroid autoimmunity/function parameters."

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of risk factors, including abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia (intended as an increase in triglyceride levels and a reduction in HDL cholesterol levels), and elevated fasting glucose, that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. With the rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome, effective dietary interventions are essential in reducing these health risks. The Mediterranean diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and olive oil and moderate in fish and poultry, has shown promise in addressing metabolic syndrome and its associated components. This diet's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, primarily due to its unsaturated fats, polyphenols, and fiber, have improved blood pressure, lipid levels, and insulin sensitivity. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been linked to reductions in central obesity and insulin resistance, both key elements in managing metabolic syndrome. Regarding lipid management, the Mediterranean diet lowers triglyceride levels and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol while raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, enhancing lipid profiles. It also helps regulate blood glucose levels, reducing the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. Additionally, the diet promotes weight loss and improves body composition, particularly by decreasing visceral fat, a primary driver of metabolic syndrome according to IDF classification. The Mediterranean diet offers a holistic approach to managing metabolic syndrome and reducing the risk of related chronic diseases. Its positive impact on metabolic health, combined with lifestyle changes like increased physical activity, provides a sustainable method for addressing the global burden of this syndrome. This review aimed to summarize the positive effects of the Mediterranean diet on the component of the metabolic syndrome with subsequent positive effects on cardiometabolic risk profile."

    "abstract": "Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune pigmentation disorder shaped by a complex interplay of genetic predispositions and environmental triggers. While conventional therapies-phototherapy, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants-can be effective, their benefits are often partial and temporary, with recurrence common once treatment stops. As such, there is increasing interest in exploring complementary approaches that may offer a more sustainable impact. Emerging evidence suggests that macronutrient and micronutrient-level changes could be beneficial for managing progression and, in some cases, facilitating repigmentation. Antioxidant-rich foods, such as apples, green tea, Indian gooseberry, onions, and peppers, may help mitigate oxidative stress, while inflammatory foods, such as gluten and high-phenol nuts and berries, may exacerbate the condition. Certain supplements, including high-dose vitamin D, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium, may enhance phototherapy outcomes. Omega-3 and other unsaturated fatty acids, in addition to prebiotics and probiotics, are under active investigation for their roles in gut health and immune regulation. Notably, plant-derived compounds, i.e., Ginkgo biloba, have demonstrated promise in promoting repigmentation and managing disease progression. However, it must be emphasized that these nutritional interventions remain exploratory, and more research is needed to establish their efficacy, safety, and optimal usage before they can be recommended as part of a standard treatment regimen."

Mediation analysis was conducted to determine specific serum biomarkers and intake of nutrients that indirectly contributed to the relationship.\nResults: Food insecurity was negatively correlated with sleep regularity. Dietary intake of fiber; vitamins A, B1, B2, C, E, and K; β-carotene; zinc; copper; and potassium and serum concentrations of palmitoleic acid had significant indirect effects on this association. The low/marginal food security group under-consumed vitamin K, and the very low food security group under-consumed vitamin K and zinc. Among food-insecure, income-eligible adults, those who received benefits from food assistance programs consumed significantly less fiber and β-carotene and exhibited significantly higher serum concentrations of palmitoleic acid than non-participants.\nConclusions: Food insecurity predicted sleep regularity, and this relationship was mediated by dietary intake and serum concentrations of specific nutrients, underscoring the role of nutrition security when evaluating potential health impacts for adults experiencing food insecurity."

One of the most common forms of dementia is Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative condition influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent research has highlighted diet as a potential modifiable risk factor for AD. Decades of research have explored the role of dietary patterns, including the Mediterranean Diet (MD) and its components, in neuroprotection and cognitive health. Systematic review examines studies investigating the impact of the Mediterranean Diet, Mediterranean-like diets, the Nordic Diet (ND), dietary intake patterns, and specific components such as extra virgin olive oil and rapeseed oil on cognitive function, disease onset, and progression in AD and dementia.\nMethods: A comprehensive search of PubMed, the Directory of Open Access Journals, and the Social Science Research Network was conducted independently by two reviewers using predefined search terms. The search period included studies from 2006 to 2024. Eligible studies meeting the inclusion criteria were systematically reviewed, yielding 88 studies: 85 focused on the MD and its relationship to AD and dementia, while only 3 investigated the ND.\nResults: The findings suggest that adherence to the Mediterranean and Nordic diets is generally associated with improved cognitive function and delayed cognitive decline and that adherence to both these diets can improve cognitive function. Some studies identified that higher legume consumption decreased dementia incidence, while fruits and vegetables, carbohydrates, and eggs lowered dementia prevalence. Most studies demonstrated that high MD or ND adherence was associated with better cognitive function and a lower risk of poor cognition in comparison to individuals with lower MD or ND adherence. However, some studies reported no significant benefits of the MD on cognitive outcomes, while two studies indicated that higher red meat consumption was linked to better cognitive function.\nConclusion: Despite promising trends, the evidence remains varying across studies, underscoring the need for further research to establish definitive associations between diet and cognitive function. These findings highlight the essential role of dietary interventions in the prevention and management of dementia and AD, therefore offering critical insights into the underlying mechanisms by which the diet may impact brain health."

    "abstract": "Background: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome of significant public health concern that causes vulnerability to physiologic stressors and an increased risk of mortality and hospitalizations. Dietary intake and quality are contributing factors to the development of frailty. The Mediterranean diet is known to be one of the healthiest eating patterns with promising health impacts for prevention. We evaluated the association between Mediterranean diet patterns and frailty status.\nMethods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2007 to 2017. We included 7300 participants aged > 60 years who completed the first day of a 24 h diet recall and had full covariate data. We constructed an alternate Mediterranean diet (aMED) score based on the quantity of specific food-group intake and categorized participants to low-, moderate-, and high-adherence groups (aMED adherence scores of 0-2, 3-4, and 5-9, respectively). Using a modified Fried Frailty phenotype (weakness, low physical activity, exhaustion, slow walking speed, and weight loss), participants were categorized as robust (met no criteria), pre-frail (met one or two criteria), and frail (met three or more criteria). Logistic regression evaluated the association of frailty (prefrail/robust as referent) and aMED adherence.\nResults: Included participants were mainly female (54.5%) and non-Hispanic White (80.0%). The mean (SD) aMED score was 3.6 (1.6) with 45% of participants falling into moderate aMED adherence (26% low adherence, 30% high adherence). Frailty prevalence among participants was 7.1%, with most participants classified as robust (51.0%) or pre-frail (41.9%). Fully adjusted models showed significantly reduced odds of frailty with moderate-adherence and high-adherence groups (odds ratio (95%CI) of 0.71 (0.55, 0.92) and 0.52 (0.36, 0.75), respectively).\nConclusions: Mediterranean diet adherence is associated with decreased odds of frailty in older adults. These findings suggest that adherence to a Mediterranean diet may play a critical role in mitigating frailty and its associated conditions. Future research should include longitudinal and interventional studies that can definitively determine the effect of a Mediterranean diet on frailty and what food components provide the greatest benefit."

The MHP group showed an increase in TL (+0.16 ± 0.13) compared to the LF group (-0.05 ± 0.13) in multiple-adjusted models (p = 0.016). An interaction was observed between the sex and dietary group, where women in the MHP group had increased TL (+0.23 ± 0.16) after 4 months compared to women in the LF group (-0.13 ± 0.15; p = 0.001); no differences between dietary groups were found in men. This increase in TL for women was associated with an increase in protein intake (p = 0.006), measured through dietary questionnaires.\nConclusion: This study shows that a MHP diet may have a protective effect on TL during weight loss, particularly in women, potentially contributing to healthier aging. These results highlight the importance of considering macronutrient composition in dietary interventions aimed at preserving TL."

    "heading": "The Impact of a Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet on Monocyte Subsets of Patients with Obesity: A Pilot Study",
    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Obesity is closely linked to chronic low-grade inflammation and the development of cardio-metabolic comorbidities. Monocyte subsets, which are crucial in immune responses, have been reported to be altered in individuals with obesity, potentially exacerbating inflammation. Although very-low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKDs) are recognized for their efficacy in promoting weight loss and improving metabolic health, their impact on circulating monocyte subsets remains poorly understood. The objective of our study is to investigate the impact of VLCKDs on monocyte subset distribution in people with obesity. Methods: Thirty-six participants were divided into four groups-healthy controls, individuals with obesity and no dietary intervention, and individuals with obesity following either a low-calorie diet (LCD) or VLCKD for 28 days. Blood samples were analyzed to assess the distribution of classical monocytes (CMs), intermediate monocytes (IMs), and non-classical monocytes (NCMs) using flow cytometry. Results: Individuals with obesity exhibited significant increases in IMs and NCMs, alongside a decrease in CMs compared to healthy controls. The VLCKD led to a notable shift in monocyte distribution, with increased CMs and reduced IMs and NCMs, restoring levels closer to those observed in healthy individuals. In contrast, the LCD group showed no significant changes in monocyte subsets. Conclusions: VLCKDs may exert anti-inflammatory effects by modulating monocyte subset distribution, offering potential therapeutic benefits in mitigating obesity-related inflammation. These preliminary findings suggest that VLCKDs could be an effective strategy for improving immune function in individuals with obesity."

    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most prevalent endocrine disorders among reproductive-aged women. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism, anovulation, and polycystic ovaries. Lifestyle changes are suggested as first-line interventions in managing PCOS. This systematic review aims to assess the scientific evidence regarding the role of lifestyle modifications (dietary changes, physical activity, and behavioral changes) in improving reproductive, anthropometric, metabolic, and psychological outcomes in women with PCOS. Dietary interventions such as foods with low glycemic index scores; caloric restrictions; high-fiber, omega three fatty acid-rich diets; ketogenic diets; Mediterranean diets; antioxidant-rich food; and anti-inflammatory diets improve insulin sensitivity and hormonal balance in women with PCOS. Physical activity, like aerobic and resistance exercise, enhances insulin sensitivity, helps weight loss, and improves metabolic and reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS. Further, behavioral and education modules can also be used to improve awareness, adherence, and the effectiveness of conventional treatment and to manage mental health issues related to PCOS. Collectively, lifestyle modifications not only improve the biochemical, hormonal, and anthropometric parameters in PCOS patients but also reduce the long-term risks of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases."

    "abstract": "Background: Long COVID (LC) is characterized by persistent symptoms at least 3 months after a SARS-COV-2 infection. LC has been associated with fungal translocation, gut dysfunction, and enhanced systemic inflammation. Currently, there is no approved treatment for this condition. The anti-inflammatory effect of vitamins K2 and D3 was shown to help attenuate the course of acute COVID-19 infection.\nObjective and hypothesis: This trial aims to investigate the effects of vitamins K2/D3 on LC symptoms, as well as gut and inflammatory markers, in people with established long COVID. Our hypothesis is that by attenuating systemic inflammation, vitamins K2/D3 will improve long COVID symptoms.\nMethods: This single-site randomized controlled study enrolled adults experiencing ≥2 moderate LC symptoms at least 3 months after a COVID-19 infection. The RECOVER Long COVID Research Index and number and type of LC symptoms were considered. Participants were randomized 2:1 to daily 240 µg K2 (pure MK-7 form) and 2000 UI vitamin D3 or standard of care (SOC) for 24 weeks. The endpoints were changes in symptomatology and in select inflammatory, metabolic, and gut biomarkers at 24 weeks.\nResults: We enrolled 151 participants (n = 98 received vit K2/D3 and 53 received SOC). The median age was 46 years; 71% were female and 29% were non-white. Baseline demographics were balanced between groups. At 24 weeks, the active treatment group only had a sharp increase in 25(OH) D, indicating good treatment adherence. In the vitamin K2/D3 arm, there was a 7.1% decrease in the proportion who had an LC Index ≥12 (vs. a 7.2% increase in the SOC group; p = 0.01). The average number of LC symptoms remained stable in the vitamin K2/D3 arm but increased in the SOC arm (p = 0.03). Additionally, reductions in oxidized LDL, inflammatory markers sTNF-RI and sCD163, and fungal translocation marker (1,3)-β-d-glucan were observed in the vitamin K2/D3 arm compared to the SOC arm (p < 0.01) over 24 weeks.\nConclusions: Vitamins K2/D3 improved the RECOVER Long COVID Index, the number of LC symptoms, and several gut and inflammatory markers. Vitamins K2/D3 provide a promising safe intervention for people suffering from long COVID."

    "abstract": "Background: Breakfast is often termed the most important meal of the day. However, its importance to acute and chronic adaptations to exercise is currently not well summarized throughout the literature.\nMethods: A narrative review of the experimental literature regarding breakfast consumption's impact on acute and chronic exercise performance and alterations in body composition prior to November 2024 was conducted. To be included in this review, the selected investigations needed to include some aspect of either endurance or resistance training performance and be conducted in humans.\nResults: These findings suggest that breakfast consumption may benefit acute long-duration (>60 min) but not short-duration (<60 min) morning endurance exercise. Evening time trial performance was consistently inhibited following breakfast omission despite the resumption of eating midday. No or minimal impact of breakfast consumption was found when examining acute morning or afternoon resistance training or the longitudinal adaptations to either resistance or endurance training. Favorable changes in body composition were often noted following the omission of breakfast. However, this was primarily driven by the concomitant reduced kilocalorie intake.\nConclusions: Consuming breakfast may aid endurance athletes regularly performing exercise lasting >60 min in length. However, the morning meal's impact on resistance training and changes in body composition appears to be minimal. Although, as the body of literature is limited, future investigations are needed to truly ascertain the dietary practice's impact."

    "abstract": "Background/objectives: Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the seventh most common cancer worldwide, with rising incidence rates and significant mortality. While tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and viral infections are established risk factors, the role of dietary patterns, particularly adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD), in HNC prevention has gained increasing attention. The aim of the current systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the association between adherence to the MD and the risk of HNC.\nMethods: A comprehensive search was conducted, following PRISMA guidelines, to identify relevant studies published up to January 2024 that assessed the association between MD adherence and HNC risk in adults. Pooled odds ratios (OR) for a three-unit increase in MD adherence scores and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).\nResults: Eleven case-control studies comprising 6106 HNC cases and 9166 controls met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. High adherence to the MD was significantly associated with a reduced risk of HNC (pooled OR = 0.561, 95% CI: 0.368-0.856, p = 0.007, I2 = 92%). Individual component analyses from three studies revealed that higher fruit and vegetable consumption significantly decreased HNC risk, whereas legumes, fish, and low meat intake showed no statistically significant associations.\nConclusions: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a significantly reduced risk of head and neck cancer. These findings support the role of the MD in cancer prevention and highlight the potential benefits of MD adherence in reducing HNC risk. Further prospective studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms."

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is known to be beneficial under such conditions owing to its antioxidant potential and insulin-sensitizing properties. The effect of NAC on the reproductive outcomes of PCOS patients was examined in this meta-analysis.\nMethods: In accordance with PRISMA standards, this meta-analysis included studies that compared N-acetylcysteine, metformin, clomiphene citrate, and a placebo in patients with POCS. The main indicators were follicular growth, endometrial thickness, and hormone level. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane ROB2 tool.\nResults: Twenty-two studies (n = 2515) were included. NAC was associated with a statistically significant increase in progesterone (SMD 0.95, 95% CI: 0.13-1.77, p = 0.02) and endometrial thickness (SMD 0.58, 95% CI: 0.10-1.06, p = 0.02) compared to the placebo and other drugs (SMD 0.71, 95% CI: 0.48-0.94, p < 0.0001). LH levels were significantly increased by NAC compared to metformin (SMD 0.67, 95% CI: 0.23-1.12, p = 0.003). However, no significant differences were observed in the estradiol, SHBG, or FSH levels.\nConclusions: NAC had a major effect on progesterone, endometrial thickness, and LH levels in women with PCOS. Therefore, it may be a potential treatment option."

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, an age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function, is increasingly recognized as a significant condition in the aging population, particularly among those with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the interplay between sarcopenia and cardiogeriatrics, emphasizing shared mechanisms such as chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), hormonal dysregulation, oxidative stress, and physical inactivity. Despite advancements in diagnostic frameworks, such as the EWGSOP2 and AWGS definitions, variability in criteria and assessment methods continues to challenge standardization. Key diagnostic tools include dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioimpedance analysis (BIA) for muscle mass, alongside functional measures such as grip strength and gait speed. The review highlights the bidirectional relationship between sarcopenia and cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure, aortic stenosis, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which exacerbate each other through complex pathophysiological mechanisms. Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting the mTOR pathway, NAD+ metabolism, and senescence-related processes offer promise in mitigating sarcopenia's progression. Additionally, integrated interventions combining resistance training, nutritional optimization, and novel anti-aging therapies hold significant potential for improving outcomes. This paper underscores critical gaps in the evidence, including the need for longitudinal studies to establish causality and the validation of advanced therapeutic approaches in clinical settings. Future research should leverage multi-omics technologies and machine learning to identify biomarkers and personalize interventions. Addressing these challenges is essential to reducing sarcopenia's burden and enhancing the quality of life for elderly individuals with comorbid cardiovascular conditions. This synthesis aims to guide future research and promote effective, individualized management strategies."

    "abstract": "Vitamin C is an antioxidant and is essential for immune function and infection resistance. Supplementation is necessary when a sufficient amount of vitamin C is not obtained through the diet. Alternative formulations of vitamin C may enhance its bioavailability and retention over traditional ascorbic acid. This systematic review consolidates the evidence on this and the effects on immunity and infection. A systematic literature search was conducted in October 2024 in Embase and Medline, focused on healthy adults (Population); oral forms of liposomal-encapsulated ascorbic acid, liposomal-encapsulated lipid metabolite ascorbic acid, calcium ascorbate, slow-release ascorbic acid, or lipid metabolite ascorbic acid (Intervention); compared to placebo/others (Comparison); in terms of bioavailability, absorption, vitamin C concentration in plasma, serum, and leukocytes, and impacts on tolerability, immunity, and infection (Outcome); and included randomized or non-randomized controlled trials, single-arm trials, and observational studies (Study design). Thirteen studies were included, several evaluating calcium ascorbate in combination with vitamin C metabolites, including L-threonate, referred to here as Calcium ascorbate EC (Ester C®; n = 7). No safety or tolerability concerns were noted with Calcium ascorbate EC vs. placebo or ascorbic acid. Calcium ascorbate EC showed better tolerability and fewer epigastric adverse events, improved quality of life, and induced favorable oxalate changes vs. ascorbic acid. Four studies reported leukocyte vitamin C concentration, some showing higher concentrations with Calcium ascorbate EC vs. ascorbic acid; seven reported more favorable plasma concentrations with the alternative forms over ascorbic acid or placebo; one reported higher serum vitamin C levels with vitamin C lipid metabolites than with Calcium ascorbate EC, calcium ascorbate, and ascorbic acid. No study reported retention in tissues. One study reported a favorable impact of Calcium ascorbate EC on immune parameters, and one found an association of Calcium ascorbate EC with fewer colds and a shorter duration of severe symptoms vs. placebo. Findings suggest that alternative vitamin C forms can improve leukocyte vitamin C, sometimes without affecting plasma levels. Most studies (77%) had a low risk of bias. In conclusion, the type and delivery modality of vitamin C can impact its bioavailability and functionality. Studies highlight the advantages of Calcium ascorbate EC over traditional ascorbic acid in terms of its tolerability and its potential to increase leukocyte vitamin C concentrations, crucial for immune function and protection against infection. However, further research is required to conclusively establish its effects on immune health."

    "abstract": "Vitamin D offers numerous under-recognized health benefits beyond its well-known role in musculoskeletal health. It is vital for extra-renal tissues, prenatal health, brain function, immunity, pregnancy, cancer prevention, and cardiovascular health. Existing guidelines issued by governmental and health organizations are bone-centric and largely overlook the abovementioned extra-skeletal benefits and optimal thresholds for vitamin D. In addition, they rely on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which seldom show benefits due to high baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, moderate supplementation doses, and flawed study designs. This review emphasizes the findings from prospective cohort studies showing that higher 25(OH)D concentrations reduce the risks of major diseases and mortality, including pregnancy and birth outcomes. Serum concentrations > 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) significantly lower disease and mortality risks compared to <20 ng/mL. With 25% of the U.S. population and 60% of Central Europeans having levels <20 ng/mL, concentrations should be raised above 30 ng/mL. This is achievable through daily supplementation with 2000 IU/day (50 mcg/day) of vitamin D3, which prevent diseases and deaths. Furthermore, a daily dose between 4000 and 6000 IU of vitamin D3 to achieve serum 25(OH)D levels between 40 and 70 ng/mL would provide greater protection against many adverse health outcomes. Future guidelines and recommendations should integrate the findings from observational prospective cohort studies and well-designed RCTs to improve public health and personalized care."

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a serious metabolic disorder, is a worldwide health problem due to the alarming rise in prevalence and elevated morbidity and mortality. Chronic hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and ineffective insulin effect and secretion are hallmarks of T2DM, leading to many serious secondary complications. These include, in particular, cardiovascular disorders, diabetic neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, diabetic foot, osteoporosis, liver damage, susceptibility to infections and some cancers. Polyphenols such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, tannins, and lignans constitute an extensive and heterogeneous group of phytochemicals in fresh fruits, vegetables and their products. Various in vitro studies, animal model studies and available clinical trials revealed that flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, kaempferol, rutin, epicatechin, genistein, daidzein, anthocyanins), phenolic acids (e.g., chlorogenic, caffeic, ellagic, gallic acids, curcumin), stilbenes (e.g., resveratrol), tannins (e.g., procyanidin B2, seaweed phlorotannins), lignans (e.g., pinoresinol) have the ability to lower hyperglycemia, enhance insulin sensitivity and improve insulin secretion, scavenge reactive oxygen species, reduce chronic inflammation, modulate gut microbiota, and alleviate secondary complications of T2DM. The interaction between polyphenols and conventional antidiabetic drugs offers a promising strategy in the management and treatment of T2DM, especially in advanced disease stages. Synergistic effects of polyphenols with antidiabetic drugs have been documented, but also antagonistic interactions that may impair drug efficacy. Therefore, additional research is required to clarify mutual interactions in order to use the knowledge in clinical applications. Nevertheless, dietary polyphenols can be successfully applied as part of supportive treatment for T2DM, as they reduce both obvious clinical symptoms and secondary complications."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent form of arthritis and affects over 528 million people worldwide. Degenerative joint disease involves cartilage degradation, subchondral bone remodeling, and synovial inflammation, leading to chronic pain, stiffness, and impaired joint function. Initially regarded as a \"wear and tear\" condition associated with aging and mechanical stress, OA is now recognized as a multifaceted disease influenced by systemic factors such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, and chronic low-grade inflammation. Recent studies have focused on the gut-joint axis to investigate how the gut microbiome modulates inflammation and pain in OA.\nMaterials and methods: A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024556265). This review included studies involving adults with symptomatic OA and analyzed the relationship between the gut microbiome and OA-related pain. Randomized and non-randomized clinical trials, case reports, editorials, and pilot studies were excluded. Searches were performed in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science without publication date restrictions, and filtered for \"observational studies\". The study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers, and the risk of bias was assessed using appropriate tools.\nResults: Five observational studies were included in the systematic review, and three were included in the meta-analysis. Two studies reported an association between different tryptophan metabolites and pain levels in patients with OA. Two other studies demonstrated a correlation between lipopolysaccharide levels and pain in OA. A fifth study confirmed the relationship between Streptococcus relative abundance of Streptococcus spp. and knee pain. These results were not supported by a meta-analysis, which found no significant association between the presence of pain in OA and the presence of bacilli of the genus Streptococcus or plasma markers of the tryptophan pathway.\nConclusions: Current evidence indicates a potential link between gut microbiome dysbiosis and OA-related pain. However, methodological limitations preclude definitive conclusions. Further research using advanced techniques and larger cohorts is needed to validate and extend these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Targeted manipulation of the gut microbiome may be a valuable strategy for pain management in OA patients."

    "abstract": "The use of creatine as a dietary supplement is widespread. However, its reported performance benefit has been largely demonstrated in male populations. The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of creatine supplementation in improving exercise performance in active females. A secondary aim was to appraise the quality of research in this area. Five databases were searched from the earliest record to July 2024. Eligible studies used supplemental creatine as an intervention with physically active female participants and reported an exercise performance-related outcome. Study quality was appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program randomised controlled trials checklist with four additional items related to methodological considerations for research with active females. Performance outcomes were categorised as strength/power, anaerobic, or aerobic. Of the 10,563 records identified, 27 studies were included. Participant calibre ranged from recreationally active to elite. Creatine interventions ranged from five days to 12 weeks and included a range of dosage strategies. Compared to placebo, 3/11 studies showed an improvement in strength/power outcomes, 4/17 showed an improvement in anaerobic outcomes, and 1/5 showed an improvement in aerobic outcomes. Study quality varied, but methodological considerations for research with female athletes were poorly addressed by most studies. Although some benefits were reported, most studies showed no improvement in performance compared to placebo. The heterogeneity in participant characteristics, performance tests, creatine intervention, insufficient consideration of the unique physiological characteristics of females, and an overall small evidence base limits our understanding of how creatine supplementation influences physical performance in active females."

This study aimed to evaluate the combined and independent effects of QCT and CIT supplementation on NO metabolites and antioxidant biomarkers in 50 trained cyclists undergoing a 20 km cycling time trial (TT).\nMethods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, forty-two male and eight female trained cyclists were assigned to QCT + CIT, QCT, CIT, or placebo (PL) groups. Supplements were consumed twice daily for 28 days. Biochemical assessments included NO metabolites (nitrate/nitrite), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and antioxidant capacity, measured pre- and post-TT.\nResults: NO metabolites were significantly elevated post-supplementation (p = 0.03); however, no significant interaction effects were observed for NO metabolites, FRAP, SOD, or antioxidant capacity across the groups (p > 0.05). Post-hoc analyses revealed that QCT significantly reduced FRAP concentrations compared to PL (p = 0.01), while no significant changes in SOD or antioxidant capacity were found across any groups.\nConclusions: These findings suggest that combined and independent QCT and CIT supplementation did not significantly improve these biomarkers, suggesting that baseline training adaptations, supplementation timing, and individual variability may influence the efficacy of these compounds in enhancing exercise performance and oxidative stress markers. The ergogenic efficacy of QCT + CIT on antioxidant-related markers remains inconclusive."

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a key factor in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, driven by the dysregulation of molecular pathways and activation of the brain's immune system, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory and oxidative molecules. This chronic inflammation is exacerbated by peripheral leukocyte infiltration into the central nervous system. Medicinal plants, with their historical use in traditional medicine, have emerged as promising candidates to mitigate neuroinflammation and offer a sustainable alternative for addressing neurodegenerative conditions in a green healthcare framework. This review evaluates the effects of medicinal plants on neuroinflammation, emphasizing their mechanisms of action, effective dosages, and clinical implications, based on a systematic search of databases such as PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science. The key findings highlight that plants like Cleistocalyx nervosum var. paniala, Curcuma longa, Cannabis sativa, and Dioscorea nipponica reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β), inhibit enzymes (COX-2 and iNOS), and activate antioxidant pathways, particularly Nrf2. NF-κB emerged as the primary pro-inflammatory pathway inhibited across studies. While the anti-inflammatory potential of these plants is significant, the variability in dosages and phytochemical compositions limits clinical translation. Here, we highlight that medicinal plants are effective modulators of neuroinflammation, underscoring their therapeutic potential. Future research should focus on animal models, standardized protocols, and safety assessments, integrating advanced methodologies, such as genetic studies and nanotechnology, to enhance their applicability in neurodegenerative disease management."

This review explores the mechanisms underlying psychedelics' effects, focusing on their ability to modulate brain connectivity and neural circuit activity, including the default mode network (DMN), cortico-striatal thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loops, and the relaxed beliefs under psychedelics (REBUS) model. Advanced neuroimaging techniques reveal psychedelics' capacity to enhance functional connectivity between sensory cerebral areas while reducing the connections between associative brain areas, decreasing the rigidity and rendering the brain more plastic and susceptible to external changings, offering insights into their therapeutic outcome. The most relevant clinical trials of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), psilocybin, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) demonstrate significant efficacy in treating treatment-resistant psychiatric conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety, with favorable safety profiles. Despite these advancements, critical gaps remain in linking psychedelics' molecular actions to their clinical efficacy. This review highlights the need for further research to integrate mechanistic insights and optimize psychedelics as tools for both therapy and understanding human cognition."

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are useful treatment options for MASLD; however, the efficacy of oral semaglutide in treating liver steatosis/fibrosis has not been fully elucidated.\nMethods: A secondary analysis of a multicenter, retrospective, observational study investigating the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes in a real-world clinical setting (the Sapporo-Oral SEMA study) was conducted. Subjects in the original cohort were divided into groups as follows: subjects with suspected MASLD (alanine aminotransferase > 30 U/L) were placed in an overall group; a subpopulation from an overall group at high risk for hepatic fibrosis (fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index ≥ 1.3 or platelet count < 200,000/µL) was placed in a high-risk group; and the remaining subjects were placed in a low-risk group. Changes in the hepatic steatosis index and FIB-4 index after oral semaglutide induction were explored using a paired t-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\nResults: Overall, 169 subjects (including 131 that switched from other medications) were analyzed, and 67 and 102 subjects were selected for the high-risk and low-risk groups, respectively. Oral semaglutide significantly improved the hepatic steatosis index (from 46.1 to 44.6, p < 0.001) and FIB-4 index (from 1.04 to 0.96, p < 0.001) as well as several metabolic parameters in all cohorts. The efficacy of semaglutide in treating liver fibrosis was confirmed by the addition of, and switching from, existing agent groups. Furthermore, improvement in the FIB-4 index was significantly negatively correlated with the baseline FIB-4 index.\nConclusions: The induction of oral semaglutide might be a useful treatment option for subjects with type 2 diabetes at high risk for liver fibrosis, even when switching from conventional medications for diabetes."

Early initiation of ART improves the prognosis of the course of HIV infection, which is explained by the reduction in the proviral reservoir pool observed in the early stages of the disease. Different HIV subtypes present differences in the number of latent reservoirs, as determined by structural and functional differences. Unique signatures of patients with HIV, such as elite controllers, have control over viral replication and can be said to have achieved a functional cure for HIV infection. Uncovering the causes of this phenomenon will bring humanity closer to curing HIV infection, potential approaches to which include stem cell transplantation, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/cas9, \"Shock and kill\", \"Block and lock\", and the application of broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs)."

    "abstract": "Lupus nephritis is one of the most severe manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus, affecting roughly 40% of all lupus patients. With the introduction of cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil, outcomes have dramatically improved. However, 10% of patients still progress towards end-stage kidney disease, which carries an elevated mortality rate. In recent years, several novel agents have been approved for use or have shown preliminary evidence of efficacy in lupus nephritis. These agents include belimumab, voclosporin, and obinutuzumab, among others. Efficacy has also been demonstrated in recent trials combining older drugs. However, determining which patients would benefit the most from novel agents or combined drug regimens and whether these drugs might serve as an alternative to current remission-induction drug regimens rather than as add-on therapies remain unresolved issues. In this review, we will explore the current evidence regarding the efficacy of novel agents."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration. Ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown promise in reducing disease activity in MS patients. This prospective study aims to assess the effectiveness of ocrelizumab in reducing confirmed disability progression in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) over a two-year period. By evaluating clinical data, and MRI findings, this study seeks to provide comprehensive insights into ocrelizumab's impact on disease dynamics and disability. Materials and Methods: Ninety-eight patients aged 18 to 65 with confirmed MS were enrolled under ocrelizumab therapy at the Neurology Department of \"Pius Brinzeu\" Clinical Emergency Hospital in Romania between July 2020 and July 2024. Participants were assessed at baseline and every six months over two years. The key outcomes measured were changes in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) as a measure of confirmed disability progression (CDP), annualized relapse rate (ARR), and MRI findings. Results: Over the two-year period, the mean EDSS score significantly decreased from 5.2 ± 1.8 to 4.6 ± 1.7 (mean change = -0.6 ± 0.9; p = 0.032), indicating improved neurological function. The proportion of patients experiencing relapses dropped markedly from 61.2% to 14.3% (p < 0.001). The MRI results showed significant reductions in patients with new or enlarging T2 lesions from 68.4% to 27.6% (p < 0.001) and gadolinium-enhancing lesions from 44.9% to 15.3% (p < 0.001). Patients previously treated with natalizumab exhibited a greater reduction in EDSS scores (-1.0 ± 0.8; p = 0.001) compared to other treatments. Multivariate regression identified the baseline EDSS score (β = 0.65; p < 0.001), previous natalizumab use (β = -0.30; p = 0.013), and age at diagnosis (β = 0.02; p = 0.048) as significant predictors of two-year EDSS scores. While markers of active inflammation decreased, the proportion of patients with brain atrophy increased from 31.6% to 43.9% (not statistically significant; p = 0.105). SPMS patients had higher rates of brain atrophy at baseline (61.1% vs. 25.0%; p = 0.007) and at two years (100.0% vs. 31.3%; p < 0.001) compared to RRMS patients. Conclusions: Ocrelizumab effectively reduced disease activity and improved neurological disability over two years in both RRMS and SPMS patients. Significant reductions in relapse rates and MRI markers of inflammation were observed. Previous natalizumab treatment was associated with greater improvements. Despite these benefits, the progression of neurodegeneration, particularly brain atrophy in SPMS patients, underscores the need for additional strategies targeting neurodegenerative aspects of MS."

    "abstract": "Background: Lateral elbow tendinopathy is a common condition that significantly alters the function of the upper extremities. In case of first-line treatment failure, different local injections are usually used. Due to the lack of sufficient evidence to support it, we conducted the study to compare the outcomes of different single injections, including Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), Corticosteroids (CS), Hyaluronic Acid (HA), and placebo (saline). Methods: Sixty patients with confirmed lateral elbow tendinopathy were enrolled in the study and divided into four groups. Pain intensity (average for the current day, at rest, during provocative tests) measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), pressure pain threshold (PPT), Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE), Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), Subjected Elbow Value (SEV), and strength of selected muscle groups were measured before and during follow-up visits (1, 4, 12, 24, and 52 weeks after treatment). The treatment was considered successful when minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was achieved in primary outcomes (VAS, PRTEE). Results: A significant improvement was achieved in most measurements in all groups. At the final follow-up, MCID for the mean pain reduction measured with VAS and improvement in the PRTEE score were achieved in 52 and 54 patients, respectively. The complete absence of pain was achieved after 1, 4, 12, 24, and 52 weeks in 2, 5, 10, 22, and 40 patients, respectively. The comparison between the groups found a significant difference in pain intensity between CS and other groups one week after injection, between the CS and PRP group in the fourth week, and between PRP and HA in the fourth week (p < 0.05). No other significant differences were found between each group at each follow-up time point. Conclusions: We conclude that each injection treatment provides good long-term clinical outcomes, but not better than placebo. A CS injection might be regarded as a more effective treatment only within the first month post-injection."

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is an emerging global health concern, and it is not only the keystone precursor of eventual liver-related morbidity, but it also places patients at considerably higher cardiovascular risk, which is still a leading cause of death in these patients. The most important common underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in these diseases are primarily related to insulin resistance, chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. The presence of MASLD with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) elevates the risk for poor outcomes, thus this review highlights a method to the therapeutic approaches. Given the intertwined nature of MASLD, T2DM, and CVD, there is an urgent need for therapeutic strategies that address all three conditions. Although lifestyle changes are important as treatment, medication plays a crucial role in managing hyperglycemia, enhancing liver function and lowering cardiovascular risk. The onset and progression of MASLD should be addressed through a multifaceted therapeutic approach, targeting inflammatory, immune, metabolic, oxidative stress, hormonal and gutaxis pathways, alongside the treatment strategies for T2DM. In this review, we discuss the effects of antidiabetic drugs with an impact on both liver outcomes and cardiovascular risk in patients affected by MASLD, T2DM and CDV."

This study assessed the impact of preoperative radiochemotherapy (CRT) on clinical staging and identified subgroups for whom definitive CRT (dCRT) may provide a favorable alternative to surgery. Methods: Sixty-one patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled. Pre-treatment staging included computed tomography, gastroscopy with biopsy, and comprehensive laboratory evaluations. Patients received preoperative CRT following the CROSS or dCRT protocols based on tumor stage. Surgical approaches included staged esophagectomy or single-stage Ivor Lewis procedures. Four patients declined surgery and were treated with dCRT. Postoperative outcomes were evaluated using pTNM classification. Follow-up included imaging and endoscopic surveillance. Statistical analyses assessed changes in staging and factors influencing treatment outcomes. Results: CRT significantly reduced T stage across the entire cohort (p = 0.0002), with complete pathological response (pT0N0M0) observed in 54.5% of patients following induction CRT (p = 0.0001). Male patients demonstrated a significant reduction in T stage (p = 0.0008), while a similar trend in females was not significant (p = 0.068). Among patients declining surgery, dCRT demonstrated acceptable oncologic control over a mean follow-up of 4 ± 0.79 years. Conclusions: Preoperative CRT effectively downstages EC and achieves high rates of response, especially in male patients. Therefore, dCRT may be a viable alternative in selected patients, emphasizing the need for individualized treatment strategies to optimize outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of refining multimodal approaches in EC care."

    "abstract": "Long COVID, also known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is increasingly recognized as a condition affecting not only adults but also children and adolescents. While children often experience milder acute COVID-19 symptoms compared to adults, some develop persistent physical, psychological, and neurological symptoms lasting for weeks or months after initial infection. The most commonly reported symptoms include debilitating fatigue, respiratory issues, headaches, muscle pain, gastrointestinal disturbances, and cognitive difficulties, which significantly impact daily activities, schooling, and social interactions. Additionally, many children with long COVID experience psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, mood swings, and irritability, likely exacerbated by prolonged illness and lifestyle disruptions. Risk factors for long COVID in children include pre-existing health conditions such as asthma, obesity, and neurological disorders, with adolescents and females seemingly more affected. Hypothesized mechanisms underlying long COVID include chronic immune dysregulation, persistent viral particles stimulating inflammation, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and mitochondrial impairment, which may collectively contribute to the variety of observed symptoms. Long-term outcomes remain uncertain; however, long COVID can lead to school absenteeism, social withdrawal, and psychological distress, potentially affecting cognitive development. Severe cases may develop chronic conditions such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and reduced exercise tolerance. This review synthesizes the existing literature on long COVID in children, examining its prevalence, symptomatology, risk factors, and potential mechanisms, with an emphasis on the need for further clinical studies. While existing research largely relies on surveys and self-reported data, clinical assessments are essential to accurately characterize long COVID in pediatric populations and to guide effective management strategies."

    "abstract": "There has been accumulating evidence over the past two decades that metformin can be an effective treatment for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in women whose diet and exercise fail to attain optimal glycemic control. The objective of this review was to comprehensively analyze all studies investigating the effectiveness of metformin compared to insulin and other drugs utilized for the treatment of GDM. After a comprehensive literature review based on PRISMA 2020, 35 studies were included after a selection process utilizing predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A variety of short-term maternal and neonatal outcomes were assessed. Metformin is a highly efficient medication for attaining optimal control of blood sugar levels in women with GDM, resulting in a significant reduction in the amount of weight gained during pregnancy. Regarding additional maternal outcomes, such as pregnancy-induced hypertension and cesarean deliveries, some studies demonstrate a link between metformin and a reduced occurrence of both conditions. In contrast, others do not find an association. Regarding short-term neonatal outcomes, metformin does not exhibit any changes in gestational age at delivery. In contrast, metformin demonstrated substantial decreases in the likelihood of greater gestational birth weight and neonatal hospitalization when compared to other drugs. When compared primarily to insulin, metformin decreases the probability of several short-term outcomes related to pregnancy and newborns. Additional data are necessary for extended follow-up studies, including patients with GDM treated with metformin."

Although its mechanism of action is not fully understood, beneficial effects have been observed in neurological diseases such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.\nObjective: This review examines the impact of the ketogenic diet and its molecular and neuroglial effects as a complementary therapy for neurological diseases.\nDiscussion: KD is associated with neuroprotective and antioxidant effects that improve mitochondrial function, regulate neurotransmitter flow, and reduce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Glial cells play an essential role in the utilization of ketone bodies (KBs) within the central nervous system's metabolism, particularly during ketosis induced by the KD. Thus, the KD represents a broad and promising strategy that involves both neurons and glial cells, with a molecular impact on brain metabolism and neuroinflammatory homeostasis.\nConclusion: Multiple molecular mechanisms have been identified to explain the benefits of the KD in neurological diseases; however, further experimental and clinical studies are needed to address various molecular pathways in order to achieve conclusive results."

    "abstract": "The treatment landscape for advanced melanoma has transformed significantly with the advent of BRAF and MEK inhibitors (BRAF/MEKi) targeting BRAFV600 mutations, as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) like anti-PD-1 monotherapy or its combinations with anti-CTLA-4 or anti-LAG-3. Despite that, many patients still do not benefit from these treatments at all or develop resistance mechanisms. Therefore, prognostic and predictive biomarkers are needed to identify patients who should switch or escalate their treatment strategies or initiate an intensive follow-up. In melanoma, liquid biopsy has shown promising results, with a potential role in predicting relapse in resected high-risk patients or in disease monitoring during the treatment of advanced disease. Several components in peripheral blood have been analyzed, such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and circulant tumoral DNA (ctDNA), which have turned out to be particularly promising. To analyze ctDNA in blood, different techniques have proven to be useful, including digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) to detect specific mutations and, more recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, which allow analyzing a broader repertoire of the mutation landscape of each patient. In this review, our goal is to update the current understanding of liquid biopsy, focusing on the use of ctDNA as a biological material in the daily clinical management of melanoma patients, in particular those with advanced disease treated with ICI."

    "abstract": "Alcohol is the second-most misused substance after tobacco. It has been identified as a causal factor in more than 200 diseases and 5.3% of all deaths and is associated with significant behavioral, social, and economic difficulties. As alcohol consumption may modulate the immune system's regulatory mechanisms to avoid attacking the body's tissues, it has been proven to play a dichotomic role in autoimmune diseases (ADs) based on the quantity of consumption. In this review, we report updated evidence on the role of alcohol in ADs, with a focus on alcohol addiction and the human biological immune system and the relationship between them, with alcohol as a risk or protective factor. Then, in this narrative review, we report the main evidence on the most studied ADs where alcohol represents a key modulator, including autoimmune thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes, allergic rhinitis, and primary biliary cholangitis. Alcohol at low-moderate dosages seems mostly to have a protective role in these diseases, while at higher dosages, the collateral risks surpass possible benefits. The specific mechanisms by which low-to-moderate alcohol intake relieves AD symptoms are not yet fully understood; however, emerging studies suggest that alcohol may have a systemic immunomodulatory effect, potentially altering the balance of anti-inflammatory innate and adaptive immune cells, as well as cytokines (via the NF-κB or NLRP3 pathways). It might influence the composition of the gut microbiome (increasing amounts of beneficial gut microbes) and the production of their fatty acid metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as well as elevated concentrations of acetate, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and nitric oxide (NO). Unfortunately, a definite acceptable daily intake (ADI) of ethanol is complicated to establish because of the many mechanisms associated with alcohol consumption such that despite the interesting content of these findings, there is a limit to their applicability and risks should be weighed in cases of alcoholic drinking recommendations. The aim of future studies should be to modulate those beneficial pathways involved in the alcohol-protective role of ADs with various strategies to avoid the risks associated with alcohol intake."

This systematic review explores the potential of exosomal biomolecules as noninvasive biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response of prostate cancer. A thorough systematic literature search through online public databases (Medline via PubMed, Scopus, and Web of science) using structured search terms and screening using predefined eligibility criteria resulted in 137 studies that we analyzed in this systematic review. We evaluated the findings from these clinical studies, revealing that the load of exosomes in the blood and urine of prostate cancer patients, which includes microRNAs (miRNAs), proteins, and lipids, demonstrates disease-specific changes. It also shows that some exosomal markers can differentiate between malignant and benign hyperplasia of the prostate, predict disease aggressiveness, and monitor treatment efficacy. Notably, miRNA emerged as the most frequently studied biomolecule, demonstrating superior diagnostic potential compared to traditional methods like prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. The analysis also highlights the pressing need for a standardised analytic approach through multi-centre studies to validate the full potential of exosomal biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of prostate cancer."

The onset of this disease is influenced by an intricate interplay of genetic and environmental factors, predisposing individuals to the psoriasis phenotype. The complex pathogenesis of psoriasis contains certain key aspects found in other autoinflammatory and autoimmune dermatological diseases. Among these, vitiligo, alopecia areata, hidradenitis suppurativa, vitiligo, connective tissue diseases, bullous dermatoses, and atopic dermatitis are conditions that share overlapping immune system dysfunction, making their relationship with psoriasis particularly significant. For our research, we explored various terms including \"shared\", \"concomitant\", \"coincident\", \"overlap\", \"coexist\", and \"concurrent\", in relation to conditions such as \"psoriasis\", \"alopecia areata\", \"hidradenitis suppurativa\", \"atopic dermatitis\", \"vitiligo\", \"bullous pemphigoid\", \"pemphigus vulgaris\", \"lupus erythematosus\", \"dermatomyositis\", and \"systemic sclerosis.\" Additionally, we used specific search queries like \"atopic dermatitis overlapping syndrome\" and \"psoriasis and vitiligo concomitant disease\" in the PubMed and Web of Science databases. While distinct in their clinical presentation, the skin diseases related to psoriasis may become associated, complicating diagnosis and treatment. In this narrative review, the complex pathophysiology of psoriasis is described, along with its close relationship to other skin conditions. This review provides an exhaustive description of both immunological and non-immunological pathways contributing to their development. Understanding the intricate interconnection between psoriasis and these conditions is of interest to scientists in developing novel research directions and to clinicians in providing holistic care, as managing one condition may influence the course of others."

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is accompanied by inflammation that underlies cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its vascular manifestations, including acute stroke, myocardial infarction, and peripheral artery disease, the leading causes of morbidity/mortality worldwide. The monolayer of endothelial cells formed on the luminal surface of arteries and veins regulates vascular tone and permeability, which supports vascular homeostasis. Endothelial dysfunction, the first step in the development of atherosclerosis, is caused by mechanical and biochemical factors that disrupt vascular homeostasis and induce inflammation. Together with increased plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking, infectious microorganisms, and genetic factors, epidemiological studies established that dysregulated metabolism of homocysteine (Hcy) causing hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with CVD. Patients with severe HHcy exhibit severe CVD and die prematurely due to vascular complications. Biochemically, HHcy is characterized by elevated levels of Hcy and related metabolites such as Hcy-thiolactone and N-Hcy-protein, seen in genetic and nutritional deficiencies in Hcy metabolism in humans and animals. The only known source of Hcy in humans is methionine released in the gut from dietary protein. Hcy is generated from S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) and metabolized to cystathionine by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and to Hcy-thiolactone by methionyl-tRNA synthetase. Hcy-thiolactone, a chemically reactive thioester, modifies protein lysine residues, generating N-homocysteinylated (N-Hcy)-protein. N-Hcy-proteins lose their normal native function and become cytotoxic, autoimmunogenic, proinflammatory, prothrombotic, and proatherogenic. Accumulating evidence, discussed in this review, shows that these Hcy metabolites can promote endothelial dysfunction, CVD, and stroke in humans by inducing pro-atherogenic changes in gene expression, upregulating mTOR signaling, and inhibiting autophagy through epigenetic mechanisms involving specific microRNAs, histone demethylase PHF8, and methylated histone H4K20me1. Clinical studies, also discussed in this review, show that cystathionine and Hcy-thiolactone are associated with myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke by influencing blood clotting. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, CVD, and stroke and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention."

Utilizing the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) database, we enriched for tumors with features of AIPC using previously described characteristics. Our AIPC cohort included three subgroups: aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC), neuroendocrine PC (NEPC), and double-negative PC (DNPC). Of 1496 total PC patients available for analysis, we identified 323 (22%) as MCRPC. Of those, 39 (12%) met AIPC criteria (17 AVPC, 13 NEPC, 9 DNPC) and 284 (88%) were non-AIPC. Forty-three percent of AIPC patients had de novo metastatic disease vs. 15% for non-AIPC (p = 0.003). Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) did not differ between cohorts, but microsatellite instability scores (MSI) were significantly higher in AIPC (p = 0.019). Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), we found that genes defining response to androgens and genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation were the most downregulated, whereas genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune signaling were significantly upregulated in AIPC vs. non-AIPC. Our study demonstrates the potential for predefined criteria that aim to enrich for AIPC and suggests opportunities for therapeutic investigation."

The most common chronic conditions diagnosed in persons 60 years and older are type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cognitive impairment. It was found that diabetes mellitus is a major risk for cognitive decline, dementia, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Different mechanisms of associations between these diseases and diabetes mellitus have been suggested. For example, it is postulated that an impaired intracellular insulin signaling pathway, together with hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, may cause pathological changes, such as dysfunction of the mitochondria, oxidative stress inflammatory responses, etc. The association between diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the mechanisms of these associations, needs further investigation.

    "abstract": "Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid widely used for its potent analgesic effects in chronic pain management and intraoperative anesthesia. However, its high potency, low cost, and accessibility have also made it a significant drug of abuse, contributing to the global opioid epidemic. This review aims to provide an in-depth analysis of fentanyl's medical applications, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and pharmacogenetics while examining its adverse effects and forensic implications. Special attention is given to its misuse, polydrug interactions, and the challenges in determining the cause of death in fentanyl-related fatalities. Fentanyl misuse has escalated dramatically, driven by its substitution for heroin and its availability through online platforms, including the dark web. Polydrug use, where fentanyl is combined with substances like xylazine, alcohol, benzodiazepines, or cocaine, exacerbates its toxicity and increases the risk of fatal outcomes. Fentanyl undergoes rapid distribution, metabolism by CYP3A4 into inactive metabolites, and renal excretion. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A4, OPRM1, and ABCB1 significantly influence individual responses to fentanyl, affecting its efficacy and potential for toxicity. Fentanyl's side effects include respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and neurocognitive impairments. Chronic misuse disrupts brain function, contributes to mental health disorders, and poses risks for younger and older populations alike. Fentanyl-related deaths require comprehensive forensic investigations, including judicial inspections, autopsies, and toxicological analyses. Additionally, the co-administration of xylazine presents distinct challenges for the scientific community. Histological and immunohistochemical studies are essential for understanding organ-specific damage, while pharmacogenetic testing can identify individual susceptibilities. The growing prevalence of fentanyl abuse highlights the need for robust forensic protocols, advanced research into its pharmacogenetic variability, and strategies to mitigate its misuse. International collaboration, public education, and harm reduction measures are critical for addressing the fentanyl crisis effectively."

As new components are discovered, more drugs are suspected of causing this disabling abnormal involuntary movement. This systematic review aims to assess the medications associated with drug-induced myoclonus (DIM). Materials and Methods: Two reviewers assessed the PubMed database using the search term \"myoclonus\", without language restriction, for articles published between 1955 and 2024. The medications found were divided into classes and sub-classes, and the subclasses were graded according to their level of evidence. Results: From 12,097 results, 1115 were found to be DIM. The subclasses of medications with level A evidence were intravenous anesthetics (etomidate), cephalosporins (ceftazidime, cefepime), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline), tricyclic antidepressant (amitriptyline), glutamate antagonist (amantadine), atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, quetiapine), antiseizure medications (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, gabapentin, pregabalin, valproate), pure opioid agonist (fentanyl, morphine), bismuth salts, and mood stabilizers (lithium). The single medication with the highest number of reports was etomidate. Drug-induced asterixis is associated with a specific list of medications. The neurotransmitters likely involved in DIM are serotonin, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate. Conclusions: DIM may be reversible with management that can include drug discontinuation, dose adjustment, and the prescription of a medication used to treat idiopathic myoclonus. Based on the main clinical constellation of symptoms and pathophysiological mechanisms found in this study, DIM can be categorized into three types: type 1 (serotonin syndrome), type 2 (non-serotonin syndrome), and type 3 (unknown)."

    "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder, affecting 3-5% of the global population and significantly impacting patients' quality of life and healthcare resources. Alongside physical symptoms such as abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, many individuals experience psychological comorbidities, including anxiety and depression. Recent research has highlighted the critical role of the gut microbiota in IBS, with dysbiosis, characterized by an imbalance in microbial diversity, frequently observed in patients. The gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network between the gut and central nervous system, plays a central role in the development of IBS symptoms. Although interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have demonstrated potential in modulating the gut microbiota and alleviating symptoms, their efficacy remains an area of ongoing investigation. This review examines the interactions between the gut microbiota, immune system, and brain, emphasizing the need for personalized therapeutic strategies. Future research should aim to identify reliable microbiota-based biomarkers for IBS and refine microbiome-targeted therapies to enhance patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is a metabolic disorder characterized by hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and abdominal obesity. Impaired insulin action or insulin resistance initiates metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of insulin resistance is increasing all over the world. Insulin resistance results in the defective metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids, in addition to low-grade chronic inflammation. Insulin resistance is associated with metabolic syndrome, which is a risk factor for a number of pathological conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Genome-wide association studies have increased our understanding of many loci linked to these diseases and others. In this review, we discuss insulin resistance and its contribution to metabolic syndrome and these diseases. We also discuss the genetic loci associated with them. Genetic testing is invaluable in the identification and stratification of susceptible populations and/or individuals. After susceptible individuals and/or populations have been identified via genetic testing or screening, lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, weight loss, a healthy diet, and smoking cessation can reduce or prevent metabolic syndrome and its associated pathologies."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Radon is a known risk factor for lung cancer, and residential radon exposure is the leading cause of lung cancer in never smokers; however, in Italy, there is still a lack of public awareness regarding the risk caused by residential radon exposure. In this mortality study, which was carried out in an Italian Apulian town (Locorotondo) of the Bari province, we aimed to analyze lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality in a population highly exposed to radon. Materials and Methods: The study period was 1998-2021. Local and Italian population and national mortality data were collected from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) website platform. Local mortality data were collected using copies of the Local Health Authority death certificates. Results: We identified 117 lung cancers in the studied period. The mortality data trends revealed a decrease in the all-causes standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), increases in the incidence rates of lung cancer and colorectal cancer in recent years, and a decrease in the incidence of noncancer diseases. We also found high SMRs for colorectal cancer until 2016 among older females. With respect to the cardio-circulatory system, only in 2014 did the male SMRs significantly influence the total SMR; after this period, a decreasing stable trend was observed. Conclusions: The natural balance of the population is decreasing, and mortality is decreasing for all causes. A future study will be needed to assess the associations between observed lung cancer cases and domestic radon exposure to drive radon mitigation and public health strategies."

    "abstract": "As an incretin hormone, Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has obvious effects on blood glucose regulation and weight loss. GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are synthetic products that have similar effects to GLP-1 but are less prone to degradation, and they are widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. In recent years, different beneficial effects of GLP-1R agonists were discovered, such as reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury, improving the function of various organs, alleviating substance use disorder, affecting tumorigenesis, regulating bone metabolism, changing gut microbiota composition, and prolonging graft survival. Therefore, GLP-1R agonists have great potential for clinical application in various diseases. Here, we briefly summarized the beneficial effects of GLP-1R agonists other than the anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects."

    "abstract": "Introduction. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a condition characterized by bilateral acute or subacute vision loss in seemingly healthy individuals. Depending on the disease stage and initial presentation, it is often diagnosed as optic neuritis. Elevated levels of endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids have been associated with the onset of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). In our patient, CSCR developed after only three days of pulse corticosteroid therapy, prescribed due to initial presentation as bilateral optic neuritis (papillitis). Objective. Through our case report, we aimed to highlight that CSCR can develop after the initiation of pulse corticosteroid therapy in a patient with LHON and to propose choroidal thickness as a potential contributing factor for this complication. Case Presentation. A 27-year-old male patient presented with painless subacute vision loss in both eyes. The decline in vision developed gradually over 20 days, prior to the patient's referral to the UKCS Eye Disease Clinic for further examination and treatment, and was not accompanied by pain during eye movements. Initial investigations upon admission to the clinic established the diagnosis of optic neuritis. Consequently, pulse corticosteroid therapy was administered. Three days after the initiation of intravenous methylprednisolone, the patient developed bilateral central serous chorioretinopathy. After cessation of therapy, there was a rapid resolution of choroidopathy, but no improvement in visual acuity, prompting genetic testing. Subsequent laboratory results revealed a positive test for the LHON mutation m.3460 G>A (MT-ND1). Conclusions. LHON is often misdiagnosed as optic neuritis, as upon initial presentation the optic nerve disk often does not exhibit the apparent characteristics of LHON. Numerous studies have documented the development of central serous chorioretinopathy following corticosteroid treatment, though none have reported the onset of CSCR after only three days of pulse corticosteroid therapy. Increased choroidal thickness is a characteristic of the acute phase of LHON and may be associated with the development of CSCR in our patient."

    "abstract": "Metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, and metabolic syndrome, are systemic conditions that profoundly impact the skin microbiota, a dynamic community of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and mites essential for cutaneous health. Dysbiosis caused by metabolic dysfunction contributes to skin barrier disruption, immune dysregulation, and increased susceptibility to inflammatory skin diseases, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and acne. For instance, hyperglycemia in T2DM leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which bind to the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) on keratinocytes and immune cells, promoting oxidative stress and inflammation while facilitating Staphylococcus aureus colonization in atopic dermatitis. Similarly, obesity-induced dysregulation of sebaceous lipid composition increases saturated fatty acids, favoring pathogenic strains of Cutibacterium acnes, which produce inflammatory metabolites that exacerbate acne. Advances in metabolomics and microbiome sequencing have unveiled critical biomarkers, such as short-chain fatty acids and microbial signatures, predictive of therapeutic outcomes. For example, elevated butyrate levels in psoriasis have been associated with reduced Th17-mediated inflammation, while the presence of specific Lactobacillus strains has shown potential to modulate immune tolerance in atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, machine learning models are increasingly used to integrate multi-omics data, enabling personalized interventions. Emerging therapies, such as probiotics and postbiotics, aim to restore microbial diversity, while phage therapy selectively targets pathogenic bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus without disrupting beneficial flora. Clinical trials have demonstrated significant reductions in inflammatory lesions and improved quality-of-life metrics in patients receiving these microbiota-targeted treatments. This review synthesizes current evidence on the bidirectional interplay between metabolic disorders and skin microbiota, highlighting therapeutic implications and future directions. By addressing systemic metabolic dysfunction and microbiota-mediated pathways, precision strategies are paving the way for improved patient outcomes in dermatologic care."

    "abstract": "For decades, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research has focused on the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which identifies amyloid-beta (Aβ) as the primary driver of the disease. However, the consistent failure of Aβ-targeted therapies to demonstrate efficacy, coupled with significant safety concerns, underscores the need to rethink our approach to AD treatment. Emerging evidence points to microbial infections as environmental factors in AD pathoetiology. Although a definitive causal link remains unestablished, the collective evidence is compelling. This review explores unconventional perspectives and emerging paradigms regarding microbial involvement in AD pathogenesis, emphasizing the gut-brain axis, brain biofilms, the oral microbiome, and viral infections. Transgenic mouse models show that gut microbiota dysregulation precedes brain Aβ accumulation, emphasizing gut-brain signaling pathways. Viral infections like Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may lead to AD by modulating host processes like the immune system. Aβ peptide's antimicrobial function as a response to microbial infection might inadvertently promote AD. We discuss potential microbiome-based therapies as promising strategies for managing and potentially preventing AD progression. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) restores gut microbial balance, reduces Aβ accumulation, and improves cognition in preclinical models. Probiotics and prebiotics reduce neuroinflammation and Aβ plaques, while antiviral therapies targeting HSV-1 and vaccines like the shingles vaccine show potential to mitigate AD pathology. Developing effective treatments requires standardized methods to identify and measure microbial infections in AD patients, enabling personalized therapies that address individual microbial contributions to AD pathogenesis. Further research is needed to clarify the interactions between microbes and Aβ, explore bacterial and viral interplay, and understand their broader effects on host processes to translate these insights into clinical interventions."

    "abstract": "Polydeoxyribonucleotides (PDRNs) and polynucleotides (PNs) are similar DNA-derived biopolymers that have garnered significant scientific attention since the 1990s for their potential applications in wound healing and skin rejuvenation. These biopolymers exhibit a broad molecular weight (MW) range, typically spanning from 50 to 1500 kDa. However, recent studies have expanded this range to encompass fragments as small as 1 kDa and as large as 10,000 kDa. Clinically, PDRN/PN formulations, commercially available in various galenic forms (gels, creams, serums, masks, and injectables), have demonstrated promising effects in significantly promoting skin regeneration, reducing inflammation, improving skin texture, preventing scar formation, and mitigating wrinkles. Importantly, despite their widespread use in cosmetology and aesthetic dermatology, the interchangeable use of the terms \"PDRN\" and \"PN\" in the scientific literature (to describe polymers of varying lengths) has led to considerable confusion within the medical and scientific communities. To specifically address this PDRN/PN ambiguity, this narrative review proposes a standardized structure-based nomenclature for these DNA-derived polymers, the \"Marques Polynucleotide Cutoff\", set at 1500 kDa. Thus, we propose that the term \"PDRN\" should be exclusively reserved for small- and medium-chain polymers (MW < 1500 kDa), while the term \"PN\" should specifically be used to denote longer-chain polymers (MW ≥ 1500 kDa). In a broader perspective, this classification is based on the distinct physicochemical properties and therapeutic effects of these DNA fragments of various MWs, which are comprehensively discussed in the present review."

The two most common symptoms are post-exertional malaise (PEM) and orthostatic intolerance (OI). ME/CFS patients with OI (ME+OI) suffer from dizziness or faintness due to a sudden drop in blood pressure while maintaining an upright posture. Clinical research has demonstrated that patients with OI display severe cardiovascular abnormalities resulting in reduced effective blood flow in the cerebral blood vessels. However, despite intense investigation, it is not known why the effective cerebral blood flow is reduced in OI patients. Based on our recent findings, we observed that tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) metabolism was highly dysregulated in ME+OI patients. In the current review article, we attempted to summarize our recent findings on BH4 metabolism to shed light on the molecular mechanisms of OI."

The aim of this prospective study in a group of people with progressive MS was to determine whether changes in the levels of selected serum biomarkers and in cognitive function may predict disease progression, and therefore refine the decision-making process in the evaluation of MS patients. Forty two (42) patients with progressive MS completed all the study procedures; the mean duration of follow-up was 12.97 months. During the observation period, serum concentration of chitinase-3 like-protein-1 (CHI3L1/YKL-40) decreased significantly in the whole study group (from 4034.95 ± 262.62 to 2866.43 ± 173.37; p = 0.0005), as well as in subgroups of people with secondary progressive and primary progressive MS (SPMS: from 3693.81 ± 388.68 to 2542.76 ± 256.59; p = 0.0207; and PPMS: from 4376.09 ± 353.27 to 3190.09 ± 233.22; p = 0.0089, respectively). A significant worsening of Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) scores was detected in the whole study group (from 1.18 ± 0.14 to 1.34 ± 0.15; p = 0.0331) as well as in the PPMS subgroup (from 1.04 ± 0.18 to 1.26 ± 0.20; p = 0.0216). No correlations between the analyzed molecular parameters or the results of neuropsychological tests and physical disability were observed. In conclusion, an emphasis should be placed on furthering the search for multimodal biomarkers of disease progression, especially in the PMS population, based on simultaneous analysis of several factors, such as blood biomarkers and cognitive profiles."

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with relapsing nature. Estimates are that approximately 2-3% of the world's population suffers from this disease. More severe forms of psoriasis are conditions of high inflammation, which is confirmed by the clinical picture and numerous inflammatory parameters such as C-reactive protein (CRP), cytokines and homocysteine, which vary with disease activity. The objective of this clinical study was to investigate the effect of GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide therapy on pro-inflammatory factors in the serum and the severity of the clinical picture of psoriasis in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on chronic metformin therapy. This randomized clinical study was conducted on 31 psoriatic patients with T2DM that were randomized into two groups: one that received semaglutide during the 12-week trial (n = 15), while the second was control (n = 16). The results demonstrated that the severity of the clinical picture of psoriasis, determined by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score, was significantly better after the administration of semaglutide (the median baseline PASI score in patients treated with semaglutide was 21 (IQR = 19.8), while after 12 weeks of therapy the score was 10 (IQR = 6; p = 0.002). Also, the quality of life in the group of patients who received the drug, measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), improved significantly after 3 months (a median baseline DLQI score in the semaglutide group was 14 (IQR = 5) at the beginning of the study, and after 12 weeks of treatment the median DLQI score was 4 (IQR = 4; p = 0.002)). The use of semaglutide led to a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum (IL6), as well as a significant decrease in CRP values (p < 0.05). A significant decrease in the body mass index (BMI) value in the semaglutide-treated group was also identified, as well as a significant decrease in the level of low-density cholesterol (LDL) (p < 0.05). In conclusion, semaglutide, based on its systemic anti-inflammatory characteristics, could contribute to the treatment of psoriatic obese patients with T2DM."

This umbrella review of network meta-analyses evaluated their effects on cardiovascular outcomes, kidney disease progression, and adverse events, using the TOPSIS method to identify the optimal intervention based on P-scores. A total of 19 network meta-analyses and 44 randomized controlled trials involving 86,150 chronic kidney disease patients were included. Compared to placebo, SGLT2i were associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular events [Hazard ratio (HR): 0.776, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.727-0.998], kidney disease progression (HR: 0.679, 95% CI: 0.629-0.733), acute kidney injury (HR: 0.873, 95% CI: 0.773-0.907), and serious adverse events (HR: 0.881, 95% CI: 0.847-0.916). GLP1a and ns-MRA were also associated with significant reductions in cardiovascular and kidney-specific composite outcomes. Indirect evidence showed that SGLT2i demonstrated a lower risk of kidney disease progression compared to GLP1a (HR: 0.826, 95% CI: 0.716-0.952) and ns-MRA (HR: 0.818, 95% CI: 0.673-0.995), representing the best intervention across all endpoints. In conclusion, while SGLT2i, GLP1a, and ns-MRA all reduce cardiovascular and kidney disease risks in chronic kidney disease, SGLT2i appears to provide the most favorable balance of efficacy and safety."

Beyond its well-known neurological features, emerging evidence underscores the pivotal role of the gut-brain axis and gastrointestinal microbiota in PD pathogenesis. Dysbiosis has been strongly linked to PD and is associated with increased intestinal permeability, chronic inflammation, and the production of neurotoxic metabolites that may exacerbate neuronal damage.\nMethods: This review delves into the complex interplay between PD and dysbiosis, shedding light on two peculiar subsets of dysbiosis, Helicobacter pylori infection and small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth. These conditions may not only contribute to PD progression but also influence therapeutic responses such as L-dopa efficacy.\nConclusions: The potential to modulate gut microbiota through probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics; fecal microbiota transplantation; and antibiotics represents a promising frontier for innovative PD treatments. Despite this potential, the current evidence is limited by small sample sizes and methodological variability across studies. Rigorous, large-scale, randomized placebo-controlled trials with standardized treatments in terms of composition, dosage, and duration are urgently needed to validate these findings and pave the way for microbiota-based therapeutic strategies in PD management."

    "abstract": "The biological process of aging is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors. Recent advancements in the fields of epigenetics and senolytics offer promising avenues for understanding and addressing age-related diseases. Epigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, with mechanisms like DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA regulation playing critical roles in aging. Senolytics, a class of drugs targeting and eliminating senescent cells, address the accumulation of dysfunctional cells that contribute to tissue degradation and chronic inflammation through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. This scoping review examines the intersection of epigenetic mechanisms and senolytic therapies in aging, focusing on their combined potential for therapeutic interventions. Senescent cells display distinct epigenetic signatures, such as DNA hypermethylation and histone modifications, which can be targeted to enhance senolytic efficacy. Epigenetic reprogramming strategies, such as induced pluripotent stem cells, may further complement senolytics by rejuvenating aged cells. Integrating epigenetic modulation with senolytic therapy offers a dual approach to improving healthspan and mitigating age-related pathologies. This narrative review underscores the need for continued research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions and suggests future directions for therapeutic development, including clinical trials, biomarker discovery, and combination therapies that synergistically target aging processes."

Recently, the ARANOTE trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Darolutamide + ADT in this setting. We aimed to update a network meta-analysis (NMA) of these combination therapies. Methods: We conducted a systematic search for RCTs on systemic therapies for mHSPC using MEDLINE, Embase, and the Web of Science Core Collection in September 2024. An NMA utilizing random-effects models was performed to compare progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse event (AE) incidence (PROSPERO: CRD42024591458). Results: A total of 12 RCTs (n = 11,954) were included in our NMAs. Triplet therapies were associated with significant improvements in PFS compared to ARPI-based doublet therapies (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-0.93; p = 0.01), but the difference did not reach the conventional levels of statistical significance for OS (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.67-1.01; p = 0.059). In a subset analysis, compared to ARPI-based doublet therapies, triplet therapies showed a significant improvement in PFS in patients with high-volume disease (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.47-0.88; p < 0.01), whereas no significant improvement was observed in those with low-volume disease (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.45-1.67; p = 0.7). No significant difference in grade ≥ 3 AEs was observed between triplet therapies and ARPI-based doublet therapies. The main limitations include patient heterogeneity and limited follow-up in some studies. Conclusions: Triplet therapies can improve the oncologic outcomes of patients with mHSPC compared to ARPI-based doublet therapies, without significantly increasing severe AEs. These findings warrant further confirmation in a head-to-head trial powered for overall survival."

In this way, we aim to encourage an update in practices based on the latest scientific evidence.\nResults: A review of various international guidelines, some dating back to 2014, shows significant variation in approaches, ranging from initial diagnostic procedures to managing relapses. The most recent guidelines also lacked references to the latest literature, indicating that more robust scientific evidence is needed before new treatments, such as electrochemotherapy for palliation and reconstructive surgery post exenteration, can be widely adopted.\nConclusions: From the systematic comparison of the main international guidelines, a strong heterogeneity emerged in the diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations as well as for the multidisciplinary approach that today is essential.

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic syndrome, introduced by the American Heart Association in 2023, represents a complex and interconnected spectrum of diseases driven by shared pathophysiological mechanisms. However, this framework notably excludes the liver-an organ fundamental to metabolic regulation. Building on this concept, Cardiovascular-Renal-Hepatic-Metabolic (CRHM) syndrome incorporates the liver's pivotal role in this interconnected disease spectrum, particularly through its involvement via metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Despite the increasing prevalence of CRHM syndrome, unified management strategies remain insufficiently explored. This review addresses the following critical question: How can novel anti-diabetic agents, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), and dual gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1RA, offer an integrated approach to managing CRHM syndrome beyond the boundaries of traditional specialties? By synthesizing evidence from landmark clinical trials, we highlight the paradigm-shifting potential of these therapies. SGLT2is, such as dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, have emerged as cornerstone guideline-directed treatments for heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), providing benefits that extend beyond glycemic control and are independent of diabetes status. GLP-1RAs, e.g., semaglutide, have transformed obesity management by enabling weight reductions exceeding 15% and improving outcomes in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), diabetic CKD, HF, and MASLD. Additionally, tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1RA, enables unprecedented weight loss (>20%), reduces diabetes risk by over 90%, and improves outcomes in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), MASLD, and obstructive sleep apnea. By moving beyond the traditional organ-specific approach, we propose a unified framework that integrates these agents into holistic management strategies for CRHM syndrome. This paradigm shift moves away from fragmented, organ-centric management toward a more unified approach, fostering collaboration across specialties and marking progress in precision cardiometabolic medicine."

    "heading": "Impact of Early-Life Microbiota on Immune System Development and Allergic Disorders",
    "abstract": "Introduction: The shaping of the human intestinal microbiota starts during the intrauterine period and continues through the subsequent stages of extrauterine life. The microbiota plays a significant role in the predisposition and development of immune diseases, as well as various inflammatory processes. Importantly, the proper colonization of the fetal digestive system is influenced by maternal microbiota, the method of pregnancy completion and the further formation of the microbiota. In the subsequent stages of a child's life, breastfeeding, diet and the use of antibiotics influence the state of eubiosis, which determines proper growth and development from the neonatal period to adulthood. The literature data suggest that there is evidence to confirm that the intestinal microbiota of the infant plays an important role in regulating the immune response associated with the development of allergic diseases. However, the identification of specific bacterial species in relation to specific types of reactions in allergic diseases is the basic problem. Background: The main aim of the review was to demonstrate the influence of the microbiota of the mother, fetus and newborn on the functioning of the immune system in the context of allergies and asthma. Methods: We reviewed and thoroughly analyzed the content of over 1000 articles and abstracts between the beginning of June and the end of August 2024. Over 150 articles were selected for the detailed study. Results: The selection was based on the PubMed National Library of Medicine search engine, using selected keywords: \"the impact of intestinal microbiota on the development of immune diseases and asthma\", \"intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases\", \"the impact of intrauterine microbiota on the development of asthma\", \"intrauterine microbiota and immune diseases\", \"intrauterine microbiota and atopic dermatitis\", \"intrauterine microbiota and food allergies\", \"maternal microbiota\", \"fetal microbiota\" and \"neonatal microbiota\". The above relationships constituted the main criteria for including articles in the analysis. Conclusions: In the present review, we showed a relationship between the proper maternal microbiota and the normal functioning of the fetal and neonatal immune system. The state of eubiosis with an adequate amount and diversity of microbiota is essential in preventing the development of immune and allergic diseases. The way the microbiota is shaped, resulting from the health-promoting behavior of pregnant women, the rational conduct of the medical staff and the proper performance of the diagnostic and therapeutic process, is necessary to maintain the health of the mother and the child. Therefore, an appropriate lifestyle, rational antibiotic therapy as well as the way of completing the pregnancy are indispensable in the prevention of the above conditions. At the same time, considering the intestinal microbiota of the newborn in relation to the genera and phyla of bacteria that have a potentially protective effect, it is worth noting that the use of suitable probiotics and prebiotics seems to contribute to the protective effect."

    "heading": "Stem Cell Therapy for the Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Comparison of the Efficacy of Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Neural Stem Cells, and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells",
    "abstract": "Background/objectives: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a debilitating, incurable neurodegenerative disorder characterised by motor neuron death in the spinal cord, brainstem, and motor cortex. With an incidence rate of about 4.42 cases per 100,000 people annually, ALS severely impacts motor function and quality of life, causing progressive muscle atrophy, spasticity, paralysis, and eventually death. The cause of ALS is largely unknown, with 90% of cases being sporadic and 10% familial. Current research targets molecular mechanisms of inflammation, excitotoxicity, aggregation-prone proteins, and proteinopathy.\nMethods: This review evaluates the efficacy of three stem cell types in ALS treatment: mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).\nResults: MSCs, derived from various tissues, show neuroprotective and regenerative qualities, with clinical trials suggesting potential benefits but limited by small sample sizes and non-randomised designs. NSCs, isolated from the fetal spinal cord or brain, demonstrate promise in animal models but face functional integration and ethical challenges. iPSCs, created by reprogramming patient-specific somatic cells, offer a novel approach by potentially replacing or supporting neurons. iPSC therapy addresses ethical issues related to embryonic stem cells but encounters challenges regarding genotoxicity and epigenetic irregularities, somatic cell sources, privacy concerns, the need for extensive clinical trials, and high reprogramming costs.\nConclusions: This research is significant for advancing ALS treatment beyond symptomatic relief and modest survival extensions to actively modifying disease progression and improving patient outcomes. Successful stem cell therapies could lead to new ALS treatments, slowing motor function loss and reducing symptom severity."

    "abstract": "Background: The benefit of universal CAR-T cells over autologous CAR-T cell therapy is that they are a treatment that is ready to use. However, the prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and host-versus-graft reaction (HVGR) remains challenging. Deleting class I of human leukocyte antigen (HLA-I) and class II of human leukocyte antigen (HLA-II) can prevent rejection by allogeneic T cells; however, natural killer (NK) cell rejection due to the loss of self-recognition remains unresolved. This study tested whether the overexpression of Lectin-like transcript 1 (LLT1), an NK cell inhibitory ligand, in T cell receptor (TCR) and HLA-I/II disrupted universal CD38-targeting CAR-T cells could prevent rejection by allogeneic NK cells.\nMethods: We generated CD38-targeting universal CAR-T cells by transducing T cells with lentiviruses encoding the CD38 CAR and LLT1 constructs. T cells were subjected to CD38, TCR, HLA-I, and HLA-II gene knockdown using CRISPR/Cas9, followed by lentiviral transduction. We performed cytotoxicity, proliferation, and cytokine assays to evaluate the functionality of universal chimeric antigen receptor-T cell (UCAR-T) cells and conducted in vitro and in vivo assays, including allogeneic responses and RNA sequencing, to assess their resistance to allogeneic T and NK cells, anti-leukemia efficacy, and persistence in treating hematologic malignancies.\nResults: Genetic editing of CD38 universal CAR-T cells, including CD38, T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), and class II major histocompatibility complex transactivator (CIITA) knockdowns, was successfully achieved. In vitro, LLT1 overexpression boosted CAR-T cell proliferation and antitumor activity, leading to a transcriptional signature characterized by elevated stemness-related markers (SELL, BCL6, TCF7, and CD27) and increased levels of IL-10 and other cytokines. It also effectively mitigates rejection by allogeneic NK and T cells. In a humanized T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) model, CD38 allogeneic universal CAR-T cells demonstrated superior survival rates and tumor clearance with reduced inflammatory responses.\nConclusion: According to these results, LLT1 overexpression enhances UCAR-T cell activity and prevents allogeneic rejection, providing essential insights for the development of universal CAR-T cell therapy."

    "abstract": "Background: The evolving infant gut microbiome influences host immune development and later health outcomes. Early antibiotic exposure could impact microbiome development and contribute to poor outcomes. Here, we use a prospective longitudinal birth cohort of n = 323 healthy term African American children to determine the association between antibiotic exposure and the gut microbiome through shotgun metagenomics sequencing as well as bile acid profiles through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.\nResults: Stool samples were collected at ages 4, 12, and 24 months for antibiotic-exposed (n = 170) and unexposed (n = 153) participants. A short-term substudy (n = 39) collected stool samples at first exposure, and over 3 weeks following antibiotics initiation. Antibiotic exposure (predominantly amoxicillin) was associated with minimal microbiome differences, whereas all tested taxa were modified by breastfeeding. In the short-term substudy, we observed microbiome differences only in the first 2 weeks following antibiotics initiation, mainly a decrease in Bifidobacterium bifidum. The differences did not persist a month after antibiotic exposure. Four species were associated with infant age. Antibiotic exposure was not associated with an increase in antibiotic resistance gene abundance or with differences in microbiome-derived fecal bile acid composition.\nConclusions: Short-term and long-term gut microbiome perturbations by antibiotic exposure were detectable but substantially smaller than those associated with breastfeeding and infant age."

    "abstract": "Microplastics, as an emerging environmental pollutant, have received widespread attention for their potential impact on ecosystems and human health. Microplastics are defined as plastic particles less than 5 millimeters in diameter and can be categorized as primary and secondary microplastics. Primary microplastics usually originate directly from industrial production, while secondary microplastics are formed by the degradation of larger plastic items. Microplastics are capable of triggering cytotoxicity and chronic inflammation, and may promote cancer through mechanisms such as pro-inflammatory responses, oxidative stress and endocrine disruption. In addition, improved microplastics bring new perspectives to cancer therapy, and studies of microplastics as drug carriers are underway, showing potential for high targeting and bioavailability. Although current studies suggest an association between microplastics and certain cancers (e.g., lung, liver, and breast cancers), the long-term effects and specific mechanisms still need to be studied. This review aimed at exploring the carcinogenicity of microplastics and their promising applications in cancer therapy provides important directions for future research and emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary collaboration to address this global health challenge."

    "abstract": "Background: Initial antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia is frequently empirical and resistance to antimicrobial agents represents a great challenge to the treatment of patients hospitalized with pneumonia. We evaluated the frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria causing pneumonia in US hospitals.\nMethods: Bacterial isolates were consecutively collected (1/patient) from patients hospitalized with pneumonia and the susceptibility of Gram-negative bacilli (3,911 Enterobacterales and 2,753 non-fermenters) was evaluated by broth microdilution in a monitoring laboratory. Isolates were collected in 69 medical centers in 2020-2022. Aztreonam-avibactam was tested with avibactam at fixed 4 mg/L and a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic susceptible (S) breakpoint of ≤ 8 mg/L was applied for comparison. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE; isolates with MIC values of > 2 mg/L for imipenem and/or meropenem) isolates were screened for carbapenemases by whole genome sequencing.\nResults: Gram-negative bacilli represented 71.1% of organisms. The most common Gram-negative species were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.4% of organisms), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), Escherichia coli (6.6%), Serratia marcescens (6.2%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.9%), and Enterobacter cloacae complex (4.8%). Aztreonam-avibactam inhibited 100.0% of Enterobacterales at ≤ 8 mg/L and 99.9% at ≤ 4 mg/L and showed potent activity against CRE (MIC50/90, 0.25/1 mg/L). Ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem-vaborbactam were active against 89.4% and 88.5% of CREs, respectively. Aztreonam-avibactam retained activity against Enterobacterales non-susceptible to ceftazidime-avibactam and/or meropenem-vaborbactam (n = 19; MIC50/90, 0.25/4 mg/L). The most common carbapenemases were KPC (69.2% of CREs), NDM (9.6%), and SME (4.8%). A carbapenemase gene was not identified in 16.3% of CREs. Ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem-vaborbactam were highly active against KPC and SME producers but showed limited activity against MBL producers. The most active comparators against CRE were tigecycline (95.2%S), amikacin (73.1%S), and gentamicin (60.6%S). Among Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 79.1% were inhibited at ≤ 8 mg/L of aztreonam-avibactam, 77.2% were meropenem susceptible, and 77.2% were piperacillin-tazobactam susceptible. Aztreonam-avibactam was highly active against S. maltophilia, inhibiting 99.5% of isolates at ≤ 8 mg/L.\nConclusions: Aztreonam-avibactam displayed potent in vitro activity against a large collection of contemporary Gram-negative organisms isolated from patients hospitalized with pneumonia, including CRE isolates resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam and/or meropenem-vaborbactam. Results of surveillance programs are valuable for planning empiric antimicrobial therapy guidelines and infection control measures."

    "abstract": "Background: Metastasis is a leading cause of cancer-related death in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of the metastasis of various cancers. However, the functional effects and regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs in metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) remain largely unknown.\nMethods: The expression of circBNC2 in prostate cancer (PCa), CRPC and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) tissues was analyzed through bioinformatics analysis. Functional assays, including cell proliferation, migration, invasion and ferroptosis, were conducted in vitro and in vivo. The interactions between circBNC2, miR-4298, and ACSL6 were explored via luciferase reporter assays, RNA immunoprecipitation, and western blotting analysis. In addition, for the first time in PCa, we developed novel nanobowls (NBs) loaded with docetaxel (DTX) and circBNC2 (Dc-NBs) and evaluated the antitumor efficacy of Dc-NBs in a photothermal therapy (PTT) strategy.\nResults: We identified a novel tumor-suppressive circRNA, circBNC2, in human PCa, CRPC and NEPC samples via bioinformatic analysis. CircBNC2 expression was significantly downregulated in PCa tissues and PCa cell lines. Functional assays demonstrated that circBNC2 inhibited PCa cell proliferation and migration both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circBNC2 acted as a sponge for miR-4298, and ACSL6 was identified as a direct target of the circBNC2/miR-4298 axis. Moreover, we demonstrated that ACSL6 is essential for mediating circBNC2-regulated ferroptosis in PCa cells. More importantly, we demonstrated the nanodelivery of Dc-NBs, which exhibited significant antitumor effects in both subcutaneous and metastatic PCa models.\nConclusion: This study revealed the tumor-suppressive role of circBNC2 in mCRPC by driving ferroptosis via the circBNC2/miR-4298/ACSL6 axis. Additionally, we developed an efficient and safe PTT strategy based on a nanodelivery system that codelivers circBNC2 and DTX, highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic approach for mCRPC."

    "abstract": "Background: The Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, a concept recently proposed by the American Heart Association (AHA), highlights the intricate connection between metabolic, renal, and cardiovascular illnesses. Furthermore, the Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP), a useful biomarker for evaluating the risk of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs), has been associated with the risk of Adverse Cardiovascular Events (ACEs). Nonetheless, its precise function in populations in CKM syndrome Stages 0-3 remains unknown.\nMethods: This prospective study analyzed the data of 7,708 eligible participants (aged ≥ 45 years) from the Chinese Longitudinal Research of Ageing (CHARLS), particularly the 2011-2012 baseline survey (Wave 1). The primary exposure variable was AIP-a natural logarithm of the ratio of Triglycerides (TGs) to High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C). On the other hand, the primary endpoint was CVD incidence, which was determined based on self-reported past diagnoses. The relationship between AIP and CVD risk in the population in CKM syndrome stages 0-3 was examined using a Cox proportional risk model. Subgroup and mediation analyses were performed to further elucidate the interactions among these factors.\nResults: This study involved 7,708 participants in the CKM syndrome stages 0-3 [Mean age = 58.00 years; Interquartile Range (IQR) = 52.00-65.00 years]. The risk of developing CVD increased significantly with higher AIP levels. Specifically, the risk ratio for each unit increase in AIP was 1.31 (95% CI 1.11-1.55), while the Hazard Ratio (HR) for the group with the highest AIP levels compared to the group with the lowest AIP levels was 1.22 (95% CI 1.08-1.39). Mediation analysis revealed that metabolic syndrome accounted for 12.3% of the association between AIP levels and CVD risk (p = 0.024), highlighting its significance in CVD risk assessment.\nConclusion: Herein, AIP levels correlated significantly positively with CVD risk in individuals in CKM stages 0-3, with metabolic syndrome as a key mediating factor. These findings suggest that AIP levels could be valuable not only for CVD risk assessment but also for clinical screening."

    "abstract": "Background: The high mortality rate of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is primarily attributed to resistance to chemotherapy, where cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a crucial role. Deubiquitinating enzymes are essential regulators of CSC maintenance, making them potential targets for eliminating CSCs and overcoming chemotherapy resistance. This study aims to identify key deubiquitinating enzymes regulating CSCs and drug resistance of CRC.\nMethods: RNA sequencing was performed to examine the mRNA expression of known deubiquitinating enzymes in CRC tissues from patients with alternate response to chemotherapy. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to evaluate the function of USP4 in regulation of stemness and drug sensitivity in CRC. High-throughput virtual screening and target management assays were conducted to identify small molecule inhibitor targeting USP4. Cell lines, organoids and animal models were used to evaluate the function of USP4 and its small molecule inhibitor in stemness and chemotherapy response.\nResults: The expression of USP4 was significantly elevated in CRC samples from progressive disease (PD) or stable disease (SD) patients compared to partial response (PR) specimen. USP4 promoted stemness by stabilizing the β-catenin and Twist1 proteins in CRC cells. A natural small molecule product U4-I05 diminished the stem-like features of CSCs and enhanced their sensitivity to oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil by targeting inhibition of its deubiquitinating enzyme activity through binding the catalytic domain of USP4 (311 cysteine site) at nanomolar concentrations, triggering proteasome-mediated degradation of β-catenin and Twist1. Treatment with U4-I05 also inhibited tumor metastasis and extended survival in a genetically engineered CRC mouse model.\nConclusions: This study identifies U4-I05 as a USP4 inhibitor with significant therapeutic efficacy against CRC, offering a promising avenue for the development of new treatments targeting cancer stemness and chemotherapy resistance."

The effects of BD on both mothers and children remain unclear. In this paper, we present the diagnostic and treatment processes for a patient with BD during pregnancy.\nCase presentation: A 20-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, presented to our inpatient department with recurrent oral and genital ulcers at 28 weeks and 3 days of gestation. Given the complexity of the patient's condition, we initiated the first multidisciplinary consultation to establish appropriate treatment regimens. However, the initial treatment was ineffective, and the patient experienced a fever for four days. Consequently, we conducted a second multidisciplinary consultation. The final treatment regimen included azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, prednisone, and low-molecular-weight heparin calcium. The clinical symptoms resolved, and the female neonate was delivered successfully. No relapse was observed during the four-month follow-up.\nConclusions: The critical issues in treatment involve ensuring medication safety for pregnant women and preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes. Notably, one potential cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes in individuals with BD is vasculopathy, which necessitates prompt treatment with anticoagulant therapy. Obstetricians should closely monitor disease progression and remain vigilant for complications in order to minimize adverse outcomes during pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Background: Fungal invasive infections caused by Candida species pose a substantial public health risk with limited therapeutic options. Antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) is necessary to optimize the therapy. The study aimed to compare different AFST methods of Candida spp. and detect FKS gene mutations among caspofungin-intermediate and resistant isolates.\nMethods: A total of 60 non-replicative invasive Candida isolates recovered from various clinical samples were included. In-vitro AFST was carried out using the ATB FUNGUS 3, Vitek-2 AST-YS08, and E-test. Hotspot (HS) regions of FKS genes were sequenced for caspofungin-intermediate and resistant isolates.\nResults: Candida albicans (58.3%) was the most predominant spp., followed by C. glabrata (28.3%). Based on the clinical breakpoints (CBPs), fluconazole resistance was found in C. albicans (45.7%), C. tropicalis (25%), and the C. parapsilosis isolate, while 35.3% of C. glabrata were susceptible dose-dependent (SDD). None of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, or C. parapsilosis isolates were resistant to voriconazole. Using the epidemiological cut-off values (ECVs) for amphotericin B, 6.7% of isolates were non-wild type (non-WT), including C. guilliermondii (50%), C. tropicalis (25%), and C. glabrata (11.8%), while all C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. kefyr isolates were classified as wild-type (WT). ATB FUNGUS 3 and Vitek-2 had the highest categorical agreement (CA) (83.1%) for amphotericin B, while a lower concordance was detected with voriconazole (23.2%) and fluconazole (52.2%). For caspofungin, Vitek-2 and E-test had a CA of 89.8%. Eleven isolates (10 C. glabrata and one C. parapsilosis) exhibited resistance or intermediate susceptibility to caspofungin (MICs: 0.25‒>32 µg/ml). Molecular characterization of the FKS gene demonstrated that FKS1 mutations V47I, V52K, V56T, D57S, L62F, I71Y, I71Q in the HS1 region, and G7S, P11H mutations in the HS2 region were associated with increased caspofungin MIC values (16 µg/ml). Mutations at the HS1 of the FKS2 gene; K33V, W35K, and W35V; were associated with the highest caspofungin MICs of > 32 µg/ml.\nConclusions: ATB FUNGUS 3 demonstrated acceptable performance for AFST, however, azole activity against Candida spp. should be interpreted carefully. Novel mutations within HS regions of FKS genes elucidated different levels of caspofungin resistance in C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis isolates."

Ketamine was dosed twice daily at 0.75 mg/kg/dose (Cohort 1) or 1.5 mg/kg/dose (Cohort 2). An independent safety monitoring committee evaluated safety and approved proceeding to the next dose cohort. Caregivers, participants, outcome assessors, and study staff except pharmacists were blinded to allocation. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. Exploratory efficacy endpoints included change in clinician- and caregiver-rated measures of RTT features, brain activity on electroencephalography, and wearable biosensors to measure respiration, heart rate, sleep, and activity.\nResults: Twenty-three participants enrolled (11 in Cohort 1, 12 in Cohort 2) from 3/12/2019-11/22/2021. One participant was excluded from analysis due to not meeting inclusion criteria on blinded review prior to analysis. One participant was withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event (vomiting) after the first dose of ketamine. Although planned for four dose cohorts, the trial was stopped after Cohort 2 due to enrollment challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Ketamine was safe and tolerated in both cohorts, with 1 related treatment emergent adverse event of vomiting. No difference was observed in efficacy between ketamine and placebo. Electroencephalography showed the expected increase in high frequency power with ketamine.\nConclusions: Short-term, low-dose oral ketamine was safe and well tolerated in girls with RTT. No clinical efficacy of ketamine in treating symptoms of RTT was observed with 5 days of treatment, despite electroencephalography evidence of ketamine target engagement during the first dose. Further studies are needed to evaluate safety and efficacy of higher dose and longer exposure to ketamine in RTT.\nTrial registration: Registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT03633058."

    "abstract": "This study reports the diagnosis and treatment of a 26-year-old pregnant woman with severe malnutrition combined with acute pyelonephritis causing sepsis, refractory septic shock and multiple organ failure. A female patient, 26 years old, was admitted to hospital mainly due to \"menelipsis for more than 19 weeks, nausea and vomiting for 20 days, fever with fatigue for 3 days\". At the end of 19 weeks of intrauterine pregnancy, the patient presented with fever accompanied by urinary tract irritation. Laboratory tests showed elevated inflammatory indicators, and ultrasonography showed bilateral pelvicalyceal dilation. She was diagnosed with acute pyelonephritis, sepsis, acute kidney injury (AKI) and severe malnutrition. After a whole-hospital consultation, the patient was treated with meropenem and vancomycin as antimicrobial therapy, and bilateral nephrostomy drainage was performed simultaneously. After that, the patient suffered a sudden decrease in blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, and rapid heart rate. Septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction was considered, and she was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) immediately. After the patient was transferred to ICU, emergency tracheal intubation and ventilator-assisted ventilation were performed. Rapid fluid resuscitation was administered for the patient. While pulse indicator continuous cardiac output (PICCO) monitoring was performed, norepinephrine, terlipressin, and methylene blue were administered to maintain peripheral vascular resistance. Since the patient developed septic cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock later, levosimendan and epinephrine were admi-nistered to improve cardiac function. While etiological specimens were delivered, meropenem, teicoplanin and caspofungin were given as initial empiric antimicrobial therapy. Unfortunately, the intrauterine fetal death occurred on the night of admission to ICU. On the 3rd day of ICU admission, a still-born child was delivered vaginally with 1/5 defect of the fetal membrane. On the 6th day of ICU admission, the patient had fever again with elevated inflammatory indicators. After excluding infection in other parts, intrau-terine infection caused by incomplete delivery of fetal membrane was considered. Then emergency uterine curettage was performed and the infection gradually improved. Later the laboratory results showed that the nephrostomy drainage was cultured for Escherichia coli and uterine, cervical and vaginal secretions were cultured for Candida albicans. Due to severe infection and intrauterine incomplete abortion, the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Active antimicrobial therapy and blood product supplement were given. However, the patient was critically ill with significant decrease in hemoglobin and platelets combined with multiple organ failure. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) was not excluded yet, so plasma exchange was performed for the patient in order not to delay treatment. The patient underwent bedside continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for AKI. The patient was complicated with acute liver injury, and the liver function gradually returned to normal after liver protection, antimicrobial therapy and other treatments. Due to the application of large doses of vasoactive drugs, the extremities of the patient gradually developed cyanosis and ischemic necrosis. Local dry gangrene of the bilateral toes remained at the time of discharge. In general, the patient suffered from septic shock, cardiogenic shock, combined with DIC and multiple organ dysfunction. After infection source control, antimicrobial therapy, uterine curettage, blood purification treatment, nutritional and metabolic support, the patient was discharged with a better health condition."

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare necrotising vasculitis affecting small vessels accompanied by eosinophilic inflammation. Biological therapies, particularly anti-interleukin-5 (IL-5) monoclonal antibodies, have been shown to be effective in treating refractory EGPA. Mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, has been approved in Japan for the treatment of EGPA and has a significant glucocorticoid-sparing effect. Benralizumab, an anti-IL-5 receptor monoclonal antibody, has also been reported to reduce the glucocorticoid dose in patients with EGPA. However, several investigators have reported the development of EGPA during biologic treatment. Herein, we present a case of development of refractory EGPA under benralizumab treatment. Although the initial treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids and the administration of benralizumab were temporally effective, the patient's condition did not improve, and the eosinophil count reelevated. After switching benralizumab to mepolizumab, the patient's condition improved, and remission was achieved. Our report suggested that mepolizumab may be an effective treatment option for refractory EGPA after failure of benralizumab treatment."

    "abstract": "Mutations in cancer risk genes increase susceptibility, but not all carriers develop cancer. Indeed, while DNA mutations are necessary drivers of cancer, only a small subset of mutated cells go on to cause the disease. To date, the mechanisms underlying individual cancer susceptibility remain unclear. Here, we took advantage of a unique mouse model of intrinsic developmental heterogeneity (Trim28+/D9) to investigate whether early-life epigenetic variation influences cancer susceptibility later in life. We found that heterozygosity of Trim28 is sufficient to generate two distinct early-life epigenetic states associated with differing cancer susceptibility. These developmentally primed states exhibit differential methylation patterns at typically silenced heterochromatin, detectable as early as 10 days of age. The differentially methylated loci are enriched for genes with known oncogenic potential, frequently mutated in human cancers and correlated with poor prognosis. This study provides genetic evidence that intrinsic developmental heterogeneity can prime individual, lifelong cancer susceptibility."

    "abstract": "Small non-coding RNAs can be categorized into two main classes: structural RNAs and regulatory RNAs. Structural RNAs, which are abundant and ubiquitously expressed, have essential roles in the maturation of pre-mRNAs, modification of rRNAs and the translation of coding transcripts. By contrast, regulatory RNAs are often expressed in a developmental-specific, tissue-specific or cell-type-specific manner and exert precise control over gene expression. Reductions in cost and improvements in the accuracy of high-throughput RNA sequencing have led to the identification of many new small RNA species. In this Review, we provide a broad discussion of the genomic origins, biogenesis and functions of structural small RNAs, including tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), vault RNAs (vtRNAs) and Y RNAs as well as their derived RNA fragments, and of regulatory small RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), in animals."

Defects in canonical Wnt signalling, which is transduced intracellularly by β-catenin, have been associated with developmental disorders, degenerative diseases and cancers. Although a simple model describing Wnt-β-catenin signalling is widely used to introduce this pathway and has largely remained unchanged over the past 30 years, in this Review we discuss recent studies that have provided important new insights into the mechanisms of Wnt production, receptor activation and intracellular signalling that advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie this important cell-cell communication system. In addition, we review the recent development of molecules capable of activating the Wnt-β-catenin pathway with selectivity in vitro and in vivo that is enabling new lines of study to pave the way for the development of Wnt therapies for the treatment of human diseases."

    "abstract": "Cilia are motile or sensory organelles present on many eukaryotic cells. Their formation and function rely on axonemal microtubules, which exhibit very slow dynamics, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unexplored. Here we reconstituted in vitro the individual and collective activities of the ciliary tip module proteins CEP104, CSPP1, TOGARAM1, ARMC9 and CCDC66, which interact with each other and with microtubules and, when mutated in humans, cause ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome. We show that CEP104, a protein with a tubulin-binding TOG domain, and its luminal partner CSPP1 inhibit microtubule growth and shortening. Another TOG-domain protein, TOGARAM1, overcomes growth inhibition imposed by CEP104 and CSPP1. CCDC66 and ARMC9 do not affect microtubule dynamics but act as scaffolds for their partners. Cryo-electron tomography demonstrated that, together, ciliary tip module members form plus-end-specific cork-like structures that reduce protofilament flaring. The combined effect of these proteins is very slow processive microtubule elongation, which recapitulates axonemal dynamics in cells."

This review summarizes the determinants of resistance among the five most common curable STIs Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Treponema pallidum, and Trichomonas vaginalis, as well as strategies to mitigate the spread of resistance.\nRecent findings: Genetic mutations are key drivers of resistance for N. gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium. Resistance in T. vaginalis can also occur because of genetic mutations, yet differential regulation of genes critical in antibiotic metabolism as well as co-infection with organisms that inactivate therapy play important roles. While resistance in C. trachomatis and T. pallidum has not been a substantial clinical concern, resistance selection via the continued widespread use of antimicrobials remains possible. While resistance determinants are diverse and differ by pathogen, the strategies required to mitigate the continued emergence of resistance are similar: prevention of infection and treatment diversification. Underpinning those strategies, surveillance remains essential for monitoring and responding to the threat of drug-resistant infections."

Previous research found that the main culprits of TSD development in cancer patients are cytotoxic drugs such as taxol, fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and anthracycline-based drugs. The advent of targeted drugs such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) has significantly extended the survival time of cancer patients, and thus widely used in clinical practice. However, the association between the use of VEGFR-TKIs and the development of TSDs havs not been studied.The adverse event(AE) reports related to VEGFR-TKIs were downloaded from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Disproportionality analysis was conducted to assess the correlation between VEGFR-TKIs and TSDs. The Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Queries (SMQs) were used to analyze the AEs of TSDs. The study found a statistically significant correlation between the occurrence of TSDs and the use of VEGF-TKIs (cabozantinib, axitinib, pazopanib, sunitinib, nintedanib, and lenvatinib).However, the instructions for Nintedanib, Sorafenib and Lenvatinib were not mentioned. Capbottinib demonstrated the highest number of reports(1790 cases), also with the strongest association (ROR 95%CI-low = 16.51; PRR = 16.18; IC025 = 3.96) when analyzing the narrow SMQ of TSDs. Dysgeusia, taste disorder, and ageusia were the most commonly reported preferred terms (PTs) in VEGFR-TKI-related TSDs, accounting for more than 90% of the reported cases. Cabozantinib showed the highest number of reports and strongest correlation with ageusia, taste disorder, parosmia, and anosmia. The study found significant association between the reports of TSDs and the use of VEGFR-TKIs, indicating the monitoring of TSD development and appropriate management in clinical is necessary."

In breast cancer, preclinical studies showed that inhibitors of the Na+/K+ ATPase suppress CTC clusters and block metastasis. Here we conducted a prospective, open-label, proof-of-concept study in women with metastatic breast cancer, where the primary objective was to determine whether treatment with the Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor digoxin could reduce mean CTC cluster size. An analysis of nine patients treated daily with a maintenance digoxin dose (0.7-1.4 ng ml-1 serum level) revealed a mean cluster size reduction of -2.2 cells per cluster upon treatment (P = 0.003), meeting the primary endpoint of the study. Mechanistically, transcriptome profiling of CTCs highlighted downregulation of cell-cell adhesion and cell-cycle-related genes upon treatment with digoxin, in line with its cluster-dissolution activity. No treatment-related adverse events occurred. Thus, our data provide a first-in-human proof of principle that digoxin treatment leads to a partial CTC cluster dissolution, encouraging larger follow-up studies with refined Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitors and that include clinical outcome endpoints.

    "abstract": "Astrocytes help protect neurons from potential damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). While ROS can also exert beneficial effects, it remains unknown how neuronal ROS signalling is activated during memory formation, and whether astrocytes play a role in this process. Here we discover an astrocyte-to-neuron H2O2 signalling cascade in Drosophila that is essential for long-term memory formation. Stimulation of astrocytes by acetylcholine induces an increase in intracellular calcium ions, which triggers the generation of extracellular superoxide (O2•-) by astrocytic NADPH oxidase. Astrocyte-secreted superoxide dismutase 3 (Sod3) converts O2•- to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is imported into neurons of the olfactory memory centre, the mushroom body, as revealed by in vivo H2O2 imaging. Notably, Sod3 activity requires copper ions, which are supplied by neuronal amyloid precursor protein. We also find that human amyloid-β peptide, implicated in Alzheimer's disease, inhibits the nAChRα7 astrocytic cholinergic receptor and impairs memory formation by preventing H2O2 synthesis. These findings may have important implications for understanding the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease."

Given that obesity strongly influences circulating protein levels, we investigated proteins mediating the effects of obesity on coronary artery disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. By integrating two-step proteome-wide Mendelian randomization, colocalization, epigenomics and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified five mediators and prioritized collagen type VI α3 (COL6A3). COL6A3 levels were strongly increased by body mass index and increased coronary artery disease risk. Notably, the carboxyl terminus product of COL6A3, endotrophin, drove this effect. COL6A3 was highly expressed in disease-relevant cell types and tissues. Finally, we found that body fat reduction could reduce plasma levels of COL6A3-derived endotrophin, indicating a tractable way to modify endotrophin levels. In summary, we provide actionable insights into how circulating proteins mediate the effects of obesity on cardiometabolic diseases and prioritize endotrophin as a potential therapeutic target."

    "abstract": "Objectives: The aim of this study was to review the most effective topical anesthetic methods for reducing pain/discomfort prior to dental local anesthetic needle puncture for dental procedures in children and adolescents.\nMethods: A scoping review was conducted. Individual search strategies were developed for each of the bibliographic databases (Cochrane, Embase, LILACS, LIVIVO, Pubmed, Scopus, PsyINFO, Web of Science), and in the gray literature (Google Scholar, Open Gray), comprehensively, without restrictions on language, publication data, or level of socioeconomic development of the country in which the study was conducted. The search was conducted on April 21, 2021 and the updates on May 24, 2024. Randomized controlled studies conducted in patients up to 18 years of age were included. Variables collected: characteristics of the included studies, topical anesthetics evaluated, time and the mode of application.\nResults: Initially, 8579 studies were retrieved. Then 3127 were identified as eligible, of which (n = 3127), 52 studies were included in the narrative synthesis. The most commonly observed anesthetic methods with the most favorable outcomes were lidocaine, benzocaine, ice cooling, and EMLA. Spray, gel or patch were used, with application times ranging from 1 to 10 min. Mucosal cooling an ice stick was analyzed by eight studies. Only one showed a smaller reduction in pain perception scores than others.\nConclusions: Cooling is a technique with numerous clinical advantages from the clinical point of view, for reduction of pain/discomfort prior to needle puncture of dental local anesthesia in children and adolescents. It is an accessible, inexpensive and pleasant method that does not resemble needles or unpleasant tastes, nor involves systemic toxicity and complications that may be associated with others anesthetics agents. Future randomized controlled studies in accordance with the Consort Statement are needed to further investigate the topic."

    "abstract": "The visceral organ-brain axis, mediated by vagal sensory neurons, is essential for maintaining various physiological functions. Here, we investigate the impact of liver-projecting vagal sensory neurons on energy balance, hepatic steatosis, and anxiety-like behavior in mice under obesogenic conditions. A small subset of vagal sensory neurons innervate the liver and project centrally to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, area postrema, and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and peripherally to the periportal areas in the liver. The loss of these neurons prevents diet-induced obesity, and these outcomes are associated with increased energy expenditure. Although males and females exhibit improved glucose homeostasis following disruption of liver-projecting vagal sensory neurons, only male mice display increased insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, the loss of liver-projecting vagal sensory neurons limits the progression of hepatic steatosis. Intriguingly, mice lacking liver-innervating vagal sensory neurons also exhibit less anxiety-like behavior compared to control mice. Modulation of the liver-brain axis may aid in designing effective treatments for both psychiatric and metabolic disorders associated with obesity and MAFLD."

Here, we adopted an untargeted omics approach to disclose lipidomic, metabolomic and proteomic alterations in plasma and in dermal fibroblasts of PD patients carrying mutations in TMEM175 gene. We revealed a wide dysregulation of lysosome, autophagy, and mitochondrial pathways in these patients, supporting a role of this channel in regulating these cellular processes. The most significant altered lipid classes were Fatty acyls, Glycerophospholipids and Phosphosphingolipids. The plasma level of Phosphatidylcholines (PC) and Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 34:1 significantly correlated with an earlier age at onset of the disease in TMEM175 patients (p = 0.008; p = 0.006). In plasma we also observed altered amino acids metabolic pathways in PD patients. We highlighted that increased level of L-glutamate strongly correlated (p < 0.001) with the severity of motor and non-motor symptoms in PD_TMEM175 patients. In dermal fibroblasts, we disclosed alterations of proteins involved in lipids biosynthesis (PAG15, PP4P1, GALC, FYV1, PIGO, PGPS1, PLPP1), in the insulin pathway (IGF2R), in mitochondrial metabolism (ACD10, ACD11, ACADS) and autophagy (RAB7L). Interestingly, we quantified 43 lysosomal or lysosomal-related proteins, which were differentially modulated between TMEM175 patients and controls. Integrative correlation analysis of proteome and lipidome of PD_TMEM175 cellular models identified a strong positive correlation of 13 proteins involved in biosynthetic processes with PC and Ceramides. Altogether, these data provide novel insights into the molecular and metabolic alterations underlying TMEM175 mutations and may be relevant for PD prediction, diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are best known for their roles in inflammatory responses by engaging in autophagy to remove inflammasomes. Here, we describe an unrecognized role for the lysosome, showing that it finely controls macrophage inflammatory function by manipulating the lysosomal Fe2+-prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs)-NF-κB-interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) transcription pathway that directly links lysosomes with inflammatory responses. TRPML1, a lysosomal cationic channel, is activated secondarily to ROS elevation upon inflammatory stimuli, which in turn suppresses IL1B transcription, thus limiting the excessive production of IL-1β in macrophages. Mechanistically, the suppression of IL1B transcription caused by TRPML1 activation results from its modulation on the release of lysosomal Fe2+, which subsequently activates PHDs. The activated PHDs then represses transcriptional activity of NF-κB, ultimately resulting in suppressed IL1B transcription. More importantly, in vivo stimulation of TRPML1 ameliorates multiple clinical signs of Dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice, suggesting TRPML1 has potential in treating inflammatory bowel disease."

Depression and diabetes often co-occur and share genetic, lifestyle, and psychosocial risk factors. Lifestyle elements such as diet, physical activity, and sleep patterns play a role on the development and management of both conditions, highlighting the need for integrated treatment strategies. The evidence suggests that traditional management strategies focusing on either condition in isolation fall short of addressing the intertwined nature of diabetes and depression. Instead, integrated care models encompassing psychological support and medical management are recommended to improve treatment efficacy and patient adherence. Such models require collaboration across multiple healthcare disciplines, including endocrinology, psychiatry, and primary care, to offer a holistic approach to patient care. This review also identifies significant patient-related barriers to effective management, such as stigma, psychological resistance, and health literacy, which need to be addressed through patient-centered education and support systems. Future directions for research include longitudinal studies in diverse populations to further elucidate causal relationships and the exploration of novel therapeutic targets, as well as the effectiveness of healthcare models aimed at preventing the onset of one condition in individuals diagnosed with the other."

Transcriptomic profiling confirms the upregulation of genes associated with the interferon-gamma and -alpha responses in peripheral blood T cells of infertile men with oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia or non-obstructive azoospermia, with distinct T cell signatures of exhaustion and senescence discriminating the two infertile conditions.

These include enzymes important for amino acid metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, polyamine synthesis, erythropoiesis, and neurotransmitter metabolism. A third of all mammalian pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes are localized in the mitochondria; however, the molecular machinery involved in the regulation of mitochondrial pyridoxal 5'-phosphate levels in mammals remains unknown. In this study, we used a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen in erythroleukemia cells and organellar metabolomics to identify the mitochondrial inner membrane protein SLC25A38 as a regulator of mitochondrial pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Loss of SLC25A38 causes depletion of mitochondrial, but not cellular, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, and impairs cellular proliferation under both physiological and low vitamin B6 conditions. Metabolic changes associated with SLC25A38 loss suggest impaired mitochondrial pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymatic reactions, including serine to glycine conversion catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2 as well as ornithine aminotransferase. The proliferation defect of SLC25A38-null K562 cells in physiological and low vitamin B6 media can be explained by the loss of serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2-dependent production of one-carbon units and downstream de novo nucleotide synthesis. Our work points to a role for SLC25A38 in mitochondrial pyridoxal 5'-phosphate accumulation and provides insights into the pathology of congenital sideroblastic anemia."

    "abstract": "Endosomal nucleic acid sensing by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is central to antimicrobial immunity and several autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The innate immune adaptor TASL mediates, via the interaction with SLC15A4, the activation of IRF5 downstream of human TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, but the pathophysiological functions of this axis remain unexplored. Here we show that SLC15A4 deficiency results in a selective block of TLR7/9-induced IRF5 activation, while loss of TASL leads to a strong but incomplete impairment, which depends on the cell type and TLR engaged. This residual IRF5 activity is ascribed to a previously uncharacterized paralogue, Gm6377, named here TASL2. Double knockout of TASL and TASL2 (TASLDKO) phenocopies SLC15A4-deficient feeble mice showing comparable impairment of innate and humoral responses. Consequently, TASLDKO mice fail to control chronic LCMV infection, while being protected in a pristane-induced SLE disease model. Our study thus demonstrates the critical pathophysiological role of SLC15A4 and TASL/TASL2 for TLR7/9-driven inflammatory responses, further supporting the therapeutic potential of targeting this complex in SLE and related diseases."

By analyzing the lactylomes and proteomes of mouse myocardium during ischemia-reperfusion injury using mass spectrometry, we show that both Serpina3k protein expression and its lactylation at lysine 351 are increased upon reperfusion. Both Serpina3k and its human homolog, SERPINA3, are abundantly expressed in cardiac fibroblasts, but not in cardiomyocytes. Biochemically, lactylation of Serpina3k enhances protein stability. Using Serpina3k knockout mice and mice overexpressing its lactylation-deficient mutant, we find that Serpina3k protects from cardiac injury in a lysine 351 lactylation-dependent manner. Mechanistically, ischemia-reperfusion-stimulated fibroblasts secrete Serpina3k/SERPINA3, and protect cardiomyocytes from reperfusion-induced apoptosis in a paracrine fashion, partially through the activation of cardioprotective reperfusion injury salvage kinase and survivor activating factor enhancement pathways. Our results demonstrate the pivotal role of protein lactylation in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury, which may hold therapeutic value."

The genome of human papillomaviruses is circular, double-stranded DNA that encodes early and late proteins. Each of the proteins is of crucial significance in infecting the epithelium of host cells persistently and supporting viral genome integrating into host cells. Notably, E6 and E7 proteins, classified as oncoproteins, trigger the incidence of cancers by fostering cell proliferation, hindering apoptosis, evading immune surveillance, promoting cell invasion, and disrupting the balance of cellular metabolism. Therefore, targeting human papillomaviruses and decoding molecular mechanisms by which human papillomaviruses drive carcinogenesis are of great necessity to better treat human papillomaviruses-related cancers. Human papillomaviruses have been applied clinically to different facets of human papillomavirus-related cancers, including prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Several types of prophylactic vaccines have been publicly utilized worldwide and have greatly decreased the occurrence of human papillomavirus-related cancers, which have benefited numerous people. Although various therapeutic vaccines have been developed and tested clinically, none of them have been officially approved to date. Enhancing the efficacy of vaccines and searching for innovative technologies targeting human papillomaviruses remain critical challenges that warrant continuous research and attention in the future."

Similar to IRF5 and SLC15A4, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TASL have been implicated in increased susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in patients. However, the biological function of TASL in vivo and how SLE-associated SNPs increase disease risk is unknown. Here we report that mice deficient in Tasl lack responses to TLR7/9 stimulation and are protected from autoimmune symptoms induced by Aldara or pristane. Loss of Tasl reduces IRF5 phosphorylation and cytokine production in multiple immune cell types but has no effect on other aspects of TLR signaling. Conversely, an SLE-associated TASL risk variant increases TASL protein expression via codon usage, resulting in augmented cytokine production in human cells.

However, despite some advancements, a major barrier for LNP delivery is endosomal escape. Here, we develop a platform for synthesizing a class of branched ILs that improve endosomal escape. These compounds incorporate terminally branched groups that increase hepatic mRNA and ribonucleoprotein complex delivery and gene editing efficiency as well as T cell transfection compared to non-branched lipids. Through an array of complementary experiments, we determine that our lipid architecture induces greater endosomal penetration and disruption.

As part of the BENCHISTA project, we aimed to assess geographical variation in tumour stage at diagnosis through the application, by population-based cancer registries working with clinicians, of the international consensus Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines.\nMethods: This population-based, retrospective cohort study involved 67 cancer registries from 23 European countries, Australia, Brazil, Japan, and Canada. Participating cancer registries applied the Toronto Guidelines to stage all incident cases of six childhood solid tumours-neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and Wilms tumour (age 0-14 years) and Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and osteosarcoma (age ≤19 years)-diagnosed between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2017. Eligible cancer registries were those able to assign stage according to the Toronto Guidelines; information on the staging investigations conducted was collected where available. European countries were grouped by geographical area and non-European countries were considered individually. We used χ2 tests to compare stage distribution across these geographical areas and multivariable logistic models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for metastatic stage at diagnosis, using central Europe (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland) as the comparison. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to overcome potential bias from non-random missing stage information for some geographical areas and cancer types.\nFindings: Data from 10 937 patients with cancer (6031 [55·1%] male and 4906 [44·9%] female) were analysed. Tumour staging was complete for 93·1% (10 180 of 10 937) of patients, ranging from 88·7% (1347 of 1518 patients) with medulloblastoma to 96·5% (1083 of 1122 patients) with Ewing sarcoma. Stage distribution differed statistically by geographical area for neuroblastoma, Wilms tumour, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma, but not for Ewing sarcoma or medulloblastoma. After excluding patients with missing stage information and, for the sarcomas, patients aged 18-19 years, the proportions of patients with metastases detected at diagnosis were 50·3% with neuroblastoma (1435 of 2852 patients; including 1159 [40·6%] stage M and 276 [9·7%] stage MS), 35·1% with medulloblastoma (473 of 1347 patients; stages M1-M4), 32·6% with Ewing sarcoma (335 of 1028 patients), 29·0% with rhabdomyosarcoma (368 of 1267 patients), 25·5% with osteosarcoma (345 of 1353 patients), and 18·2% with Wilms tumour (384 of 2114 patients). After adjusting by age group, significant differences in the proportions of patients with metastases detected at diagnosis were found between geographical areas for neuroblastoma, Wilms tumour, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.\nInterpretation: Assessed at a population level, the stage at diagnosis shows significant variation between geographical areas for several childhood tumours. This finding highlights the need for earlier diagnosis and standardisation of investigations for distant metastases. To enable ongoing comparisons, further cooperation efforts are required between cancer registries and clinicians regarding the sustainable and standardised use of the Toronto Guidelines at diagnosis.\nFunding: Children with Cancer UK and Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro."

    "heading": "Characteristics of children and adolescents with multidrug-resistant and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis and their association with treatment outcomes: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Background: There are few data on the treatment of children and adolescents with multidrug-resistant (MDR) or rifampicin-resistant (RR) tuberculosis, especially with more recently available drugs and regimens. We aimed to describe the clinical and treatment characteristics and their associations with treatment outcomes in this susceptible population.\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. Databases were searched from Oct 1, 2014, to March 30, 2020. To be eligible, studies must have included more than five children or adolescents (0-19 years of age) treated for microbiologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed MDR or RR tuberculosis within a defined treatment cohort, and reported on regimen composition and treatment outcomes. Abstracts were screened independently by two authors to identify potentially eligible records. Full texts were reviewed by two authors independently to identify studies meeting the eligiblity criteria. For studies meeting eligiblity criteria, anonymised individual patient data was requested and individiual level data included for analysis. The main outcome assessed was treatment outcome defined as treatment success (cure or treatment completed) versus unfavourable outcome (treatment failure or death). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify associations between clinical and treatment factors and treatment outcomes. This study is registered with Prospero (CRD42020187230).\nFindings: 1417 studies were identified through database searching. After removing duplicates and screening for eligibility, the search identified 23 369 individual participants from 42 studies, mostly from India and South Africa. Overall, 16 825 (72·0%) were successfully treated (treatment completed or cured), 2848 died (12·2%), 722 (3·1%) had treatment failure, and 2974 (12·7%) were lost to follow-up. In primary analyses, the median age was 16 (IQR 13-18) years. Of the 17 764 (87·1%) participants with reported HIV status, 2448 (13·8%) were living with HIV. 17 707 (89·6%) had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis. After adjusting for significant factors associated with treatment outcome, the use of two (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·41 [95% CI 1·09-1·82]; p=0·008) or three (2·12 [1·61-2·79]; p<0·0001) WHO-classified group A drugs (bedaquiline, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and linezolid) compared with the use of no group A drugs at all was positively associated with treatment success.\nInterpretation: Younger and clinically diagnosed children are underrepresented among those treated for MDR and RR tuberculosis and should be a focus for case-finding efforts. Overall treatment outcomes in our analysis were better than in adults but lower than the international targets of 90% or more individuals successfully treated. Treatment with more group A drugs was associated with better treatment outcomes in children and adolescents, highlighting the need for more rapid access to these drugs and improved regimens.\nFunding: Unitaid."

Groundbreaking regulatory approvals in triple-negative breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma will certainly be followed by additional approvals in other disease indications, as clinical and basic research are burgeoning globally in hundreds of clinical trials across dozens of cancer types. As this field is evolving, it is addressing gaps in our understanding of biological mechanisms underlying PD-1 pathway blockade and their synergy with other antineoplastic drugs, probing mechanisms of response and resistance to neoadjuvant immunotherapy, optimizing efficacious clinical strategies, and analyzing commonalities and differences across cancer types. Knowledge gained thus far provides a firm foundation from which to launch the next phase of translational research in this expanding arena of biomedical investigation."

    "abstract": "Background: Current randomized controlled trials are investigating the efficacy and safety of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with medium vessel occlusion (MeVO) stroke. Whether best medical management (MM) is more efficient than unsuccessful vessel recanalization during MT remains unknown.\nMethods: This was a retrospective cohort study using data from 37 academic centers across North America, Asia, and Europe between September 2017 and July 2021. Only patients with occlusion of the distal branches (M2 and M3) of the middle cerebral artery territory were included. Unsuccessful MT was defined as a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 0-2a. Propensity score matching was used to control for confounders. The primary outcome was functional independence, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at 90 days after treatment. Multivariable regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with the primary outcome.\nResults: Of 2903 patients screened for eligibility, 532 patients were analyzed (266 per group) after propensity score matching. The MM group had superior functional outcomes, with 32% achieving mRS 0-1 at 90 days compared with 21% in the MT group (P=0.011). Patients in the MM group also had significantly lower rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) (3.4% vs 16%, P<0.001) and any hemorrhage (18% vs 48%, P<0.001). On multivariable regression, unsuccessful MT was associated with reduced odds of functional independence (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.85, P=0.011) and increased odds of sICH (OR 4.32, 95% CI 1.84 to 10.10, P<0.001). Mortality rates were similar between groups (27% in MM vs 29% in MT, P=0.73).\nConclusion: Unsuccessful MT for MeVO was linked to worse outcomes than best MM. These findings highlight the risks of prolonged attempts and emphasize the importance of efficient procedural decision-making to reduce complications and improve patient outcomes."

These new medications, though primarily designed to regulate blood glucose levels, also have applications in weight management, potentially transforming the current approaches to diabetes treatment. Newer medications, however, have ophthalmic side effects with controversies in trials and real-life data. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the ocular benefits and adverse effects of both traditional and newer-generation anti-diabetic drugs. Our primary focus is on how these newer medications affect the stage of diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, we explore the associations between these medications and other ocular conditions, including age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, orbital conditions, and diseases impacting the ocular surface. Furthermore, we provide contextual background by discussing the ocular effects of traditional anti-diabetic drugs."

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effect of silymarin on insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\nMethods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to September 2024 for relevant RCTs. The intervention required silymarin supplementation for at least 4 weeks. Primary outcomes were homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and fasting insulin (FI), while secondary outcomes included quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). Bias risk was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2. Subgroup analyses were based on disease type, duration, and dosage. Sensitivity and publication bias analyses were conducted using Egger's and Begg's tests. Statistical analysis and meta-analysis were performed using Stata 15.1.\nResults: Six studies with 673 participants from Iran, Egypt, and Italy were included. All studies had low risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed that Silybum marianum significantly improved HOMA-IR (WMD = -2.29, 95 % CI: -4.55 to -0.03, p = 0.047) but had no effect on FI (WMD = -2.56, 95 % CI: -7.60 to 2.48, p = 0.862). Subgroup analyses revealed improvements in HOMA-IR for T2DM and diabetics with alcoholic cirrhosis, but no effect in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. QUICKI did not show significant changes in any group. Only one study reported changes in QUICKI. The results indicated that, compared to the placebo, silymarin improved insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\nConclusion: In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that there is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of silymarin in improving HOMA-IR and FI levels in metabolic diseases, and it generally does not appear to significantly improve these parameters. Future studies should aim to increase the number of high-quality RCTs to further validate the efficacy and safety of silymarin, as well as to explore its underlying mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Objective: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease, especially in patients with severe obesity. However, current mouse models for MASLD do not reflect the polygenetic background nor the metabolic changes in this population. Therefore, we investigated two novel mouse models of MASLD with a polygenetic background for the metabolic syndrome.\nMethods: TALLYHO/JngJ mice and NONcNZO10/LtJ mice were fed a high-fat- high-carbohydrate (HF-HC) diet with a surplus of cholesterol diet. A second group of TH mice was additional treated with empagliflozin.\nResults: After sixteen weeks of feeding, both strains developed metabolic syndrome with severe obesity and histological manifestation of steatohepatitis, which was associated with significantly increased intrahepatic CD8+cells, CD4+cells and Tregs, contributing to a significant increase in pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic gene activation as well as ER stress and oxidative stress. In comparison with the human transcriptomic signature, we could demonstrate a good metabolic similarity, especially for the TH mouse model. Furthermore, TH mice also developed signs of kidney injury as an extrahepatic comorbidity of MASLD. Additional treatment with empagliflozin in TH mice attenuates hepatic steatosis and improves histological manifestation of MASH.\nConclusions: Overall, we have developed two promising new mouse models that are suitable for preclinical studies of MASLD as they recapitulate most of the key features of MASLD."

    "abstract": "The consequences of non-pathogenic huntingtin (HTT) reduction in the mature brain are of substantial importance as clinical trials for numerous HTT-lowering therapies are underway; many of which are non-selective in that they reduce both mutant and wild type protein variants. In this study, we injected CaMKII-promoted AAV-Cre directly into the hippocampus of adult HTT floxed mice to explore the role of wild-type huntingtin (wtHTT) in adult hippocampal pyramidal neurons and the broader implications of its loss. Our findings reveal that wtHTT depletion results in profound macroscopic morphological abnormalities in hippocampal structure, accompanied by significant reactive gliosis. At the synaptic level, we identified a marked reduction in presynaptic terminals 1-2 months following wtHTT loss; this was contrasted by an increased density of postsynaptic mushroom spines and larger amplitudes of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, indicative of disrupted synaptic homeostasis. Furthermore, intrinsic neuronal excitability was significantly diminished in CA1 pyramidal neurons lacking wtHTT, and we observed a complete loss of NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation. Unexpectedly, synapse density returned to control levels 6-8 months following wtHTT loss, despite the ongoing presence of macroscopic morphological abnormalities, altered anxiety-related behaviors and clear impairments in spatial learning and memory. Overall, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized role of wtHTT as a critical regulator of hippocampal function in the mature brain, and highlight the hippocampus as a potentially vulnerable region to the adverse effects of non-selective HTT reduction."

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, mechanistic studies of allergic and type 2 (T2)-mediated airway inflammation have led to multiple approved therapies for the treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma. The approval and availability of these monoclonal antibodies targeting immunoglobulin E, a type 2 cytokine (IL-5) and/or cytokine receptors (IL-5Rα, IL-4Rα) has been central to the progresses made in the management of moderate-to-severe asthma over this period. However, there are persistent gaps in clinician's ability to provide precise care given that many patients with type 2-high asthma do not respond to the IgE or T2 cytokine-targeting therapies and patients with type 2-low asthma have limited therapeutic options. The new frontier of precision medicine in asthma, as well as in other allergic diseases, includes the targeting of epithelium-derived cytokines, \"alarmins\", including TSLP, IL-25, IL-33, and their receptors. The effects of these alarmins, which can act upstream of immune cells, involve both the innate and adaptive systems and hold potential for the treatment of both type 2-high and low disease. Tezepelumab, an anti-TSLP antibody has already been approved for the treatment of severe asthma. In this review we discuss our current understanding of alarmin biology with a primary focus on allergic airway diseases. We link the mechanistic corollaries to the clinical implications and advances in drug development targeting alarmins-focusing on currently approved treatments, those under study, as well as future potential targets in the alarmin signaling pathways."

Molecular allergy (MA) diagnosis establishes the patient's IgE reactivity profile at a molecular allergen level and has moved allergology into the \"Precision Medicine\" era. Molecular allergology started in the late 1980s with the isolation of the first allergen-encoding DNA sequences. Already in 2002, the first allergen microarrays were developed for the assessment of complex IgE sensitization patterns. Recombinant allergens are used for a precise definition of personal IgE reactivity profiles, identification of genuine IgE sensitization to allergen sources for refined prescription of allergen-specific immunotherapy and allergen avoidance diagnosis of co- versus cross-sensitization, epidemiological studies and prediction of symptoms, phenotypes, and development allergic disease. For example, molecular IgE sensitization patterns associated with more severe respiratory allergies, severe food allergy and allergy to honeybee or vespids are already established. The implementation of MA diagnosis into daily clinical practice requires continuous medical education, training of doctors in MA diagnosis and may be facilitated by clinical decision support systems such as diagnostic algorithms which may take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI)."

Currently, curative options for early stage and other carefully selected HCC patients include transplantation, resection, and ablation. Because of issues with organ availability, co-morbidities preventing resection, and tumor size and location limiting ablation, other treatments are necessary for this selected patient population. RADSEG method has evolved into an intra-arterial approach in this setting, with long-term outcomes comparable to ablation, resection, and transplantation. It is proposed that yttrium-90 radioembolization, applying RADSEG technique, be formally recognized as curative for early HCC."

    "abstract": "Background & aims: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a progressive subtype of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), has limited pharmacological treatment options. Therefore, we aimed to identify novel therapeutic targets.\nMethods: The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and human liver tissues obtained from patients with MASH were used to identify differentially expressed genes in MASH. The functional role of cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 2 (CMPK2) was assessed in mice with hepatocyte-specific overexpression, conditional knockout mice, and several murine MASH models. CMPK2 inhibitors were discovered through surface plasmon resonance imaging coupled with indirect enzyme activity detection.\nResults: CMPK2, a critical enzyme involved in mitochondrial DNA synthesis, exhibited significant upregulation in the livers of obese individuals with MASH and mice with diet-induced MASH. Hepatocyte-specific Cmpk2 deletion substantially mitigated liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice. Inhibition of CMPK2, either through genetic manipulation or pharmacological intervention with nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), suppressed NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (Nlrp3) inflammasome activation and subsequent hepatic pyroptosis. Furthermore, NDGA alleviated diet-induced metabolic disorders, inflammation, and fibrosis in vivo.\nConclusions: These findings establish CMPK2 as a critical mediator in the progression from metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver (MASL) to MASH and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases.\nImpact and implications: CMPK2 exhibits upregulated in the MASH stage but not in the early stages of MASLD. Our study demonstrated that diet-induced MASH phenotypes, including liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis were alleviated in hepatocyte-specific Cmpk2-knockout mice. These findings suggest that CMPK2 serve as a critical link in the progression of steatotic liver to steatohepatitis, offering novel mechanistic insights MASH development. Furthermore, this discovery identified CMPK2 as a promising target for the development of therapeutic drugs for MASH."

Recent methodological advances have enabled the identification of variance quantitative trait loci (vQTLs) where gene-environment interactions are enriched.\nObjectives: To identify vQTLs for serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) concentrations and characterize potential gene-environment interactions of vQTLs.\nMethods: We conducted vQTL discovery for 25OHD using a newly developed quantile integral linear model in the UK Biobank individuals of European (N = 313,514), African (N = 7,800), East Asian (N = 2,146), and South Asian (N = 8,771) ancestries, respectively. We tested for interactions between the identified vQTL lead variants and 18 environmental, biological, or lifestyle factors, followed by multiple sensitivity analyses.\nResults: We identified 19 independent vQTL lead variants (p-value <5x10-8) in the European ancestry population. No vQTLs were identified in the non-European ancestry populations, likely due to limited sample sizes. A total of 32 interactions were detected with a false discovery rate <0.05. While known gene-season of measurement interactions were confirmed, additional interactions were identified involving modifiable risk factors, including time spent outdoors and body mass index. The magnitudes of these interactions were consistent within each locus upon adjusting for season of measurement and other covariates. We also identified a gene-sex interaction at a vQTL that implicates DHCR7. Integrating transcript- and protein-level evidence, we found that the sex-differentiated genetic associations may act through sex-biased expression of DHCR7 isoforms in skin tissues due to alternative splicing.\nConclusions: Through the lens of vQTLs, we identified additional gene-environment interactions affecting vitamin D status in addition to season of measurement. These findings may provide new insights into the etiology of vitamin D deficiency and encourage personalized prevention and management of associated diseases for at-risk individuals."

    "abstract": "Background: PD-L1 and VEGF blockade with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab has been shown to improve survival in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. TIGIT is an immune checkpoint regulator implicated in many cancers, including unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we evaluate the clinical activity and safety of the addition of tiragolumab, an anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibody, to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.\nMethods: This randomised, open-label, phase 1b-2 umbrella study was conducted at 26 centres across China, France, Israel, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, and the USA. Eligible patients were adults aged 18 years old or older with previously untreated locally advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, Child-Pugh class A disease, and a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (2:1) using permuted block randomisation to receive either tiragolumab 600 mg plus atezolizumab 1200 mg plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg or atezolizumab 1200 mg plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, administered via intravenous infusion every 3 weeks on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Patients received treatment until unacceptable toxic effects or loss of clinical benefit, whichever occurred first. The primary endpoint was objective response rate. Analysis of clinical activity was done in the efficacy-evaluable population (all patients who received at least one dose of each drug for their assigned treatment regimen) and safety was assessed in all patients who received any study treatment. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04524871, and is ongoing.\nFindings: Between Aug 20, 2020, and Feb 10, 2022, we assessed 154 patients for eligibility and 59 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive tiragolumab plus atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (n=41) or atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (n=18); one patient in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group experienced an adverse event before receiving any treatment and withdrew from the study. Median age was 65·0 years (IQR 61·0-73·0). 46 (79%) of 58 patients were male and 12 (21%) were female. Most patients were Asian (23 [40%]) or White (21 [36%]). At the time of clinical cutoff (Aug 21, 2023), median follow-up was 20·6 months (IQR 10·6-28·0) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 14·0 months (4·2-18·5) in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group. The confirmed objective response rate was 43% (95% CI 27-59, n=17) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 11% (1-35, n=2) in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group. All patients in both groups experienced an adverse event. The incidence of pruritis (20 [50%] of 40 patients vs three [17%] of 18 patients), arthralgia (13 [33%] vs two [11%]), and diarrhoea (12 [30%] vs one [6%]) was notably higher in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group than in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group, although these were mainly grade 1-2. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hypertension (six [15%] of 40 patients in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group vs two [11%] of 18 patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group), aspartate aminotransferase increased (three [8%] of 40 patients vs one [6%] of 18 patients), and proteinuria (two [5%] of 40 patients vs two [11%] of 18 patients). Serious adverse events occurred in 21 (53%) of 40 patients in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and in ten (56%) of 18 patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in one patient in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group (due to cholestasis) and two patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group (due to oesophageal varices haemorrhage and upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage). The addition of tiragolumab to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab did not appear to result in a substantial worsening of treatment-related or immune-mediated adverse events, and no new safety signals were identified.\nInterpretation: This signal-seeking study suggests that the addition of tiragolumab to atezolizumab and bevacizumab might be more clinically active than atezolizumab plus bevacizumab alone in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Based on these data, further study of combination tiragolumab plus atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is warranted.\nFunding: F Hoffmann-La Roche and Genentech."

Using a computational approach, we designed variants of SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and selected 7 natural sarbecovirus RBDs, each predicted to fold properly and abrogate antibody responses to variable epitopes. RBDs were attached to 60-mer nanoparticles to make immunogens displaying two (mosaic-2COMs), five (mosaic-5COM), or seven (mosaic-7COM) different RBDs for comparisons with mosaic-8b, which elicited cross-reactive antibodies and protected animals from sarbecovirus challenges. Naive and COVID-19 pre-vaccinated mice immunized with mosaic-7COM elicited antibodies targeting conserved RBD epitopes, and their sera exhibited higher binding and neutralization titers against sarbecoviruses than mosaic-8b. Mosaic-2COMs and mosaic-5COM elicited higher antibody potencies against some SARS-CoV-2 variants than mosaic-7COM. However, mosaic-7COM elicited more potent responses against zoonotic sarbecoviruses and highly mutated Omicrons, supporting its use to protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants and zoonotic sarbecoviruses."

    "abstract": "Most land plants form symbioses with microbes to acquire nutrients but also must restrict infection by pathogens. Here, we show that a single pair of lysin-motif-containing receptor-like kinases, MpaLYR and MpaCERK1, mediates both immunity and symbiosis in the liverwort Marchantia paleacea. MpaLYR has a higher affinity for long-chain (CO7) versus short-chain chitin oligomers (CO4). Although both CO7 and CO4 can activate symbiosis-related genes, CO7 triggers stronger immune responses than CO4 in a dosage-dependent manner. CO4 can inhibit CO7-induced strong immune responses, recapitulating the early response to inoculation with the symbiont arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We show that phosphate starvation of plants increases their production of strigolactone, which stimulates CO4/CO5 secretion from mycorrhizal fungi, thereby prioritizing symbiosis over immunity. Thus, a single pair of LysM receptors mediates dosage-dependent perception of different chitin oligomers to discern symbiotic and pathogenic microbes in M. paleacea, which may facilitate terrestrialization."

Here, we applied our comprehensive solution of ultrasensitive proteomic technology to measure the proteomic profiles of oocytes and early embryos and identified nearly 8,000 proteins in humans and over 6,300 proteins in mice. We observed distinct proteomic dynamics before and around zygotic genome activation (ZGA) between the two species. Integrative analysis with translatomic data revealed extensive divergence between translation activation and protein accumulation. Multi-omic analysis indicated that ZGA transcripts often contribute to protein accumulation in blastocysts. Using mouse embryos, we identified several transcriptional regulators critical for early development, thereby linking ZGA to the first lineage specification. Furthermore, single-embryo proteomics of poor-quality embryos from over 100 patient couples provided insights into preimplantation development failure. Our study may contribute to reshaping the framework of mammalian preimplantation development and opening avenues for addressing human infertility."

However, subunit assembly and molecular architecture of endogenous NMDARs (eNMDARs) in the brain remain elusive. Using conformation- and subunit-dependent antibodies, we purified eNMDARs from adult rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Three major subtypes of GluN1-N2A-N2B, GluN1-N2B, and GluN1-N2A eNMDARs were resolved by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) at the resolution up to 4.2 Å. The particle ratio of these three subtypes was 9:7:4, indicating that about half of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits are incorporated into the tri-heterotetramers. Structural analysis revealed the asymmetric architecture of the GluN1-N2A-N2B receptor throughout the extracellular to the transmembrane layers. Moreover, the conformational variations between GluN1-N2B and GluN1-N2A-N2B receptors revealed the distinct biophysical properties across different eNMDAR subtypes. Our findings imply the structural and functional complexity of eNMDARs and shed light on structure-based therapeutic design targeting these eNMDARs in vivo."

We tested a microbiome restoration strategy comprising a diet that recapitulated key characteristics of non-industrialized dietary patterns (restore diet) and a bacterium rarely found in industrialized microbiomes (Limosilactobacillus reuteri) in a randomized controlled feeding trial in healthy Canadian adults. The restore diet, despite reducing gut microbiome diversity, enhanced the persistence of L. reuteri strain from rural Papua New Guinea (PB-W1) and redressed several microbiome features altered by industrialization. The diet also beneficially altered microbiota-derived plasma metabolites implicated in the etiology of chronic non-communicable diseases. Considerable cardiometabolic benefits were observed independently of L. reuteri administration, several of which could be accurately predicted by baseline and diet-responsive microbiome features. The findings suggest that a dietary intervention targeted toward restoring the gut microbiome can improve host-microbiome interactions that likely underpin chronic pathologies, which can guide dietary recommendations and the development of therapeutic and nutritional strategies."

Using cryo-ET on human mitotic chromosomes, we reveal a distinctive architecture at the centromere: clustered 20- to 25-nm nucleosome-associated complexes within chromatin clearings that delineate them from surrounding chromatin. Centromere components CENP-C and CENP-N are each required for the integrity of the complexes, while CENP-C is also required to maintain the chromatin clearing. We find that CENP-C is required in mitosis, not just for kinetochore assembly, likely reflecting its role in organizing the inner kinetochore during chromosome segregation. We further visualize the scaffold of the fibrous corona, a structure amplified at unattached kinetochores, revealing crescent-shaped parallel arrays of fibrils extending >1 μm. Thus, we reveal how the organization of centromeric chromatin creates a clearing at the site of kinetochore formation as well as the nature of kinetochore amplification mediated by corona fibrils."

Here, we present parallel-flow projection and transfer learning across omics data (PLATO), an integrated framework combining microfluidics with deep learning to enable high-resolution mapping of thousands of proteins in whole tissue sections. We validated the PLATO framework by profiling the spatial proteome of the mouse cerebellum, identifying 2,564 protein groups in a single run. We then applied PLATO to rat villus and human breast cancer samples, achieving a spatial resolution of 25 μm and uncovering proteomic dynamics associated with disease states. This approach revealed spatially distinct tumor subtypes, identified key dysregulated proteins, and provided novel insights into the complexity of the tumor microenvironment. We believe that PLATO represents a transformative platform for exploring spatial proteomic regulation and its interplay with genetic and environmental factors."

Verified inhibitors exhibit extensive physical interactions with the respective immune protein counterpart, with all inhibitors blocking the active site of the immune protein. Remarkably, a phage-encoded inhibitor of bacterial TIR proteins can bind and inhibit distantly related human and plant immune TIRs, and a phage-derived inhibitor of bacterial cGAS-like enzymes can inhibit the human cGAS. Our results demonstrate that phages are a reservoir for immune-modulatory proteins capable of inhibiting bacterial, animal, and plant immunity."

By combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with scB-cell receptor sequencing (scBCR-seq), we differentiate monoclonal/neoplastic from polyclonal/normal PCs and find more dysregulated genes, especially in precursor patients, than we would have by analyzing bulk PCs. To determine whether this approach can identify oncogenes that contribute to disease pathobiology, mitotic arrest deficient-2 like-1 (MAD2L1) and S-adenosylmethionine synthase isoform type-2 (MAT2A) are validated as targets with drug-like molecules that suppress myeloma growth in preclinical models. Moreover, functional studies show a role of lysosomal-associated membrane protein family member-5 (LAMP5), which is uniquely expressed in neoplastic PCs, in tumor progression and aggressiveness via interactions with c-MYC. Finally, a monoclonal antibody recognizing cell-surface LAMP5 shows efficacy as an antibody-drug conjugate and in a chimeric antigen receptor-guided T-cell format.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Using digital technology, respectively the use of intraoral scanners has increased exponentially in recent years. Intraoral scanners have gained traction and widespread use in the field of dental prosthetics and orthodontics. While the use of these digital devices enables the detection of visible areas of error in order to allow clinicians to correct those areas immediately without a need of restarting the entire process from the beginning as it should be done in the conventional method and subsequent procedures. While intraoral scanners provide notable benefits in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and patient comfort, they do come with certain drawbacks. The high initial cost, along with the ongoing expenses for maintenance and software updates, can place a financial strain on many dental practices. Additionally, there is a learning curve associated with mastering these devices, and certain clinical situations-such as limited mouth openings or areas that are difficult to scan-can pose challenges to their effectiveness. Accuracy may also be affected by factors like patient movement, insufficient salivation, or the presence of reflective or dark surfaces. Moreover, issues related to software compatibility, extended chair time in complex cases, and the need for multiple scanning attempts can reduce some of the time-saving advantages. Intraoral scanners also raise concerns about data security and patient privacy, and technical issues or system failures can disrupt clinical workflows. While intraoral scanners are undoubtedly valuable in modern dentistry, it is important for clinicians to carefully evaluate these limitations to ensure their effective integration into practice.\nAim of study: Acquaintance with intraoral scanners, understanding the way they're used, advantages and disadvantages, differences with the convenctional method of impression, familiarity with the materials of impression measurement.\nMaterial and methods: This study was conducted as a literature review, using the latest literature on intraoral scanners and their use in dentistry, disadvantages and advantages over conventional impressions. Analysis of scientific papers published in online databases such as PUBMED and MEDLINE, EBSCO, Google Schoolar, using the keywords \"Intraoral scanners, convenctional impression, impressions, digital dentistry\".\nConclusion: Intraoral scanners present tremendous comfort in the field of prosthodontics. When comfort is mentioned, it is worth emphasizing the advantages of working with an intraoral scanner, where the benefits are the same for both parties, patients and clinicist. Therefore, it is very important that in this period where technology is closely related with new and modern methods not only for taking impressions, but also for other procedures."

    "abstract": "The toxicokinetics of nitrosamines remain a mystery to this day, though it appears that the role of nitrosamines in potentiating the generation of mutations required for the onset of skin cancer continues to be a significant concern. Nitrosamines are mutagens, genotoxic substances, and mediators of phototoxicity/carcinogenicity, whose long-term daily usage, in the context of polypharmacy, can result in the parallel appearance of heterogeneous forms of skin cancer: keratinocytic and melanocytic. But a number of clinical observations suggest that it is the nitrosamines that potentiate the multiple occurrences of skin cancer over the years, or recurrences of skin cancer localized in areas exposed to solar radiation. This article reports the occurrences of keratoacanthoma and multiple actinic keratoses in a patient on systemic therapy with telmisartan and tamsulosin - medications that contain Nitrosamines/ NDSRIs. Successful surgical treatment by modificated advancement flap and cryotherapy was performed. The role of nitrosamines as mediators of phototoxicity in the context of drug-mediated Photo-Nitrosogenesis/ Nitrosocarcinogenesis is discussed. Contamination of certain classes of drugs with nitrosamines is proving to be more than a serious problem. This problem is fueled on the one hand by the fact that nitrosamines are 1) photocarcinogens (known for decades), but on the other hand, they are also 2) mutagens/carcinogens, genotoxic substances (according to the FDA classification). The phototoxic effect according to current data is not calculated by the tests provided by the regulators (at least so far), which in practice leads to a miscalculation of the total, cumulative carcinogenic effect in the context of the intake of a contaminated mono or polymedication. The tests could be seen as either largely static, according to some clinical observations-even as categorically insufficient in terms of defining the concept of carcinogenicity in real-world settings (such as the intake of carcinogens with drugs, for example). The processes of carcinogenesis are dynamic, multifactorial and could hardly be characterized by this kind of tests. New literature evidence finds a disconnect precisely in the determination of carcinogenic activity by assays proposed by regulators such as the Ames test (in bacteria) and the CPCA test in rodents. An open dilemma remains: since there is no concordance between the mutagenicity test in bacteria (Ames) with that in rodents (CPCA), what should be their significance in humans? For this reason, the application of the above-mentioned tests might be seriously limited in the future. We present a patient with multiple actinic keratoses and an epithelial skin tumor in the scalp area that developed during therapy with Tamsulosin and Telmisartan. We comment on the role of drug-mediated Photo-Nitrosocarcinogenesis/Oncopharmacogenesis in the background of potential/actual carcinogen contamination."

    "abstract": "Background: Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial malignant solid tumor in children, accounting for >15 % of cancer-related deaths in children. We analyzed the epidemiological statistical indicators of neuroblastoma and other peripheral nervous system tumors patients from 1990 to 2021 in Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database, aiming to provide valuable insights for public health interventions and clinical practices.\nMethods: Based on the GBD 2021 database, this study analyzed the incidence, mortality, prevalence, and Disability-Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) of neuroblastoma and other peripheral nervous system tumors from 1990 to 2021, stratified by sociodemographic development index (SDI) and geographic regions. Cross-country inequalities analysis was conducted to quantify the SDI-related inequality of disease burden across countries. In addition, the average annual percentage change (AAPC) and Age-Period-Cohort (APC) model were used to evaluate the trend of disease burden, while the global burden of disease to 2035 was predicted by Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) model.\nFindings: This study reported the disease burden of neuroblastoma and other peripheral nervous system tumors in GBD 2021 database for the first time. Globally, the incidence and mortality of neuroblastoma have increased year by year from 1990 to 2021, especially in regions with low SDI, such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where the burden of disease has increased significantly. Regions with high SDI, such as North America and Western Europe, have seen a reduction in disease burden due to higher levels of medical care and earlier diagnosis. The age distribution shows that children under 5 years of age are mainly affected, especially in low- and middle-income areas. In addition, the incidence is slightly higher in men than in women. The BAPC model predicts that the global incidence, mortality, and DALYs of neuroblastoma will continue to increase until 2035.\nInterpretation: Significant regional and population variation in neuroblastoma and other peripheral nervous system tumors worldwide, with a particularly high disease burden in low SDI areas with limited medical resources. This trend highlights the urgent need for global public health interventions and resource allocation, particularly in low-income countries. Future research should focus on improving early diagnosis, risk stratification and target therapy in order to reduce the global burden of disease and improve patients' prognosis.\nFunding: This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82293662, No 82172357 and No 81930066), Key project of Shanghai \"Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan (22JC1402304) and Research fund of Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau (No. 2019cxjq03)."

Yet, significant gaps persist in how metabolic pathways confer resistance to DDR inhibition in cancer cells. Here, we employed a metabolism-focused CRISPR knockout screen and identified genetic vulnerabilities to DDR inhibitors. We unveiled Peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) as a synthetic lethality partner with Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) kinase. Tumor cells depleted of PRDX1 displayed heightened sensitivity to ATM inhibition in vitro and in mice in a manner dependent on p53 status. Mechanistically, we discovered that the ribosomal protein RPL32 undergoes redox modification on active cysteine residues 91 and 96 upon ATM inhibition, promoting p53 stability and altered cell fitness. Our findings reveal a new pathway whereby RPL32 senses stress and induces p53 activation impairing tumor cell survival."

    "abstract": "Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy marked by drug-resistant seizures and profound cognitive and behavioral impairments, with nearly 95% of individuals affected by moderate to severe intellectual disability. This review comprehensively explores the cognitive and behavioral impacts of current treatment options for LGS, including antiseizure medications (ASMs), neuromodulation strategies, the ketogenic diet, and surgical interventions. Given the limited availability of LGS-specific data for several ASMs, the evidence base is supplemented with findings from general epilepsy populations and individuals with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. The evidence reveals that ASMs exert varied cognitive and behavioral effects in LGS. Medications such as valproate, lamotrigine, cannabidiol, fenfluramine, levetiracetam, brivaracetam, felbamate, and rufinamide generally support cognitive stability, while topiramate and zonisamide are associated with cognitive challenges. Behavioral outcomes also vary: stability is observed with valproate, lamotrigine, rufinamide, cannabidiol, and fenfluramine, whereas medications like levetiracetam, perampanel, brivaracetam, clobazam, and zonisamide can increase aggression or irritability. Nonpharmacological therapies, particularly when they reduce seizure frequency, typically provide greater cognitive and behavioral stability, with some offering improvement. Early intervention-especially through surgical options-appears most beneficial for preserving cognitive function. Additionally, therapies such as the ketogenic diet and neuromodulation may provide independent cognitive benefits beyond seizure control. This review emphasizes the importance of personalized treatment strategies, integrating cognitive and behavioral evaluations in therapy selection. Key components include baseline cognitive and behavioral assessments, followed by regular follow-up evaluations, particularly after therapy changes. Consideration of minimizing ASM polytherapy, careful evaluation of drug-drug interactions, pharmacogenomic implications, and the need for therapeutic drug monitoring in cases of cognitive adverse effects is essential. Future research should focus on developing assessment tools tailored to the unique needs of individuals with LGS, utilizing connectivity measures to assess intervention impacts, and advancing precision therapeutics to improve cognitive and behavioral outcomes."

    "abstract": "Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe, childhood-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy characterized by multiple drug-resistant seizure types, specific electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns, and significant cognitive and behavioral impairments. To date, eight anti-seizure medications (ASMs) have been specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of LGS: clonazepam, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, rufinamide, clobazam, cannabidiol, and fenfluramine. Additionally, several other ASMs, including valproate, are frequently used off-label for LGS management. As the therapeutic landscape for LGS expands, clinicians are increasingly faced with complex decisions regarding optimal ASM selection. This narrative review explores evolving treatment strategies, offering a consensus-based treatment algorithm designed by a panel of U.S.- based experts. We analyze both FDA-approved and off-label ASMs, drawing on data from randomized controlled trials, open-label extensions, and real-world studies to assess each drug's efficacy and safety profile. A key challenge in comparing ASMs lies in the heterogeneity of study designs and outcome measures. This review addresses these limitations and considers crucial factors influencing ASM selection, such as seizure outcomes, safety profiles, cognitive and behavioral outcomes, drug-drug interactions, and rational polypharmacy. Barriers to access, including economic and regulatory hurdles, are also discussed. The proposed treatment algorithm emphasizes a personalized approach to LGS management, recommending valproate or clobazam as first-line treatments, followed by individualized combinations based on the specific patient profile and associated comorbidities."

Radiation therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment and there are no medicinal products with regulatory approval. Although the biology of DMG is better characterized, this has not yet translated into effective treatments. H3K27-alterations initiate the disease but additional drivers are required for malignant growth. Hence, there is an urgent unmet need to develop new multi-modality therapeutic strategies, including alternative methods of drug delivery. ONC201 (DRD2 antagonist and mitochondrial ClpP agonist) is the most widely evaluated investigational drug. Encouraging early data is emerging for CAR T-cells and oncolytic viruses. GD2, B7-H3 and PI3K signalling are ubiquitous targets across all subtypes and therapeutics directed to these targets would potentially benefit the largest number of children. PI3K, ACVR1, MAPK and PDGFRA pathways should be targeted in rational biological combinations. Drug discovery is a very high priority. New specific and potent epigenetic modifiers (PROTACS e.g. SMARCA4 degraders), with blood-brain penetrance are needed. Cancer neuroscience therapeutics are in early development. Overall survival is the preferred regulatory endpoint. However, the evaluation of this can be influenced by the use of re-irradiation at the time of progression. An efficient clinical trial design fit for regulatory purposes for the evaluation of new therapeutics would aid industry and facilitate more efficient therapy development. Challenges in conducting clinical trials such as the need for comparator data and defining endpoints, could be addressed through an international, first-in-child, randomised, complex innovative design trial. To achieve progress: i) drug discovery; ii) new multi-modality, efficient, collaborative, pre-clinical approaches, possibly including artificial intelligence and, iii) efficient clinical trial designs fit for regulatory purposes are required."

The weighted logistic regression, restricted cubic spline, and subgroup analysis were performed using real-world data. Mendelian randomization study was conducted using genetic data from the Genome-Wide Association Study. The inverse variance weighted method was used as the primary analysis approach, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify pleiotropy and heterogeneity bias.\nResults: Individuals with PAD had higher mean BMI values compared to those without PAD (28.82 ± 5.87 and 28.31 ± 5.42, P = 0.007). For the categorical variable of BMI, individuals in obesity class 2 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.532, 95% CI = 1.082-2.169; P = 0.013) and obesity class 3 (OR = 2.479, 95% CI = 1.515-4.056; P < 0.001) had a higher risk of PAD analyzed by weighted logistic regression. Subgroup analysis revealed that the association between BMI and PAD persisted. Given that a higher BMI is associated with PAD, we selected obesity for Mendelian randomization analysis and observed that obesity had a relationship with PAD (inverse variance weight: OR = 1.194, 95% CI = 1.099-1.296; P < 0.001). The reliable findings were validated by sensitive analysis (all P > 0.05).\nConclusions: BMI is a robust risk factor for PAD. A higher BMI (especially ≥35 kg/m2) is associated with an increased risk of developing PAD. Meanwhile, there is a causal relationship between obesity and PAD. Interventions are necessary for targeted obesity prevention and management strategies for PAD."

Interest in its potential use as a dietary supplement has surged recently, especially claims related to promoting relaxation and cognitive enhancement. This review surveys the chemistry, metabolism, and purported biological activities of l-theanine. It is well absorbed from the intestine and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Some studies suggest l-theanine may increase alpha waves in the brain associated with relaxation and selective attention, reduce stress and anxiety, and improve sleep quality, though findings are often inconsistent. Potential neuroprotective and anti-seizure effects have also been reported in animal models. When combined with caffeine, l-theanine may improve cognitive performance, alertness and focus. However, the evidence supporting many health claims remains limited, especially the lack of rigorous human clinical trials. While l-theanine exhibits a good safety profile based on toxicology studies, caution is warranted regarding the purported health benefits, until stronger scientific substantiation emerges. Overall, the mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential of l-theanine require further investigation, given the current interest and increasing popularity of this nutraceutical supplement marketed for brain health and relaxation.

Topical estrogen (TE) has been proposed for symptom management, given its' local application and presumed reduced bioavailability, however its oncological safety remains uncertain.\nObjective: The present systematic review, meta-analysis and expert panel review aimed to evaluate the strength of the available evidence on the risk of recurrence and mortality when TE is utilised in congruence with TAM or AI treatment, among BC survivors.\nData sources: Six databases and two prospective registers, were interrogated from inception to January 3rd, 2024. Search terms were Breast cancer AND Hormone replacement therapy AND topical/vaginal oestrogen AND recurrence/mortality.\nStudy selection: All study designs reporting the use vs. non-use of TE in breast cancer survivors receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment were included. Six observational studies were deemed eligible for inclusion.\nData extraction and synthesis: Sources of heterogeneity were explored using subgroup analysis by risk of bias, median follow-up period, node positivity and menopausal status. Trial sequential analysis was performed to quantify outcome reliability. A global expert panel was called to deliberate on the data, pinpoint areas of limited understanding, and determine the most important areas for future research.\nMain outcomes and measures: Risk ratio effect sizes (RR) and corresponding 95 % Confidence Intervals (CI) of breast cancer recurrence and mortality in survivors on endocrine treatment (TAM and/or AI) exposed to TE were reported. Expert panel appraisal of meta-analysis evidence with definition of current knowledge gaps and future research aims.\nResults: In 38 050 female patients receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment, of whom 1805 had been exposed to TE, TE exposure of those on AI, did not increase all-cause mortality (RR 0.99 [95 %CI 0.58, 1.69], I2 = 81 %, P = 0.96; moderate GRADE certainty). However, such exposure may convey an increased risk of recurrence (RR 2.51 [95 % CI 1.10, 5.72], I2 = 9 %, P = 0.03; low-GRADE certainty). Exposure to TE during TAM did not increase either recurrence risk or all-cause mortality. Clinical factors such as lymph node positivity at the time of diagnosis and menopausal status and follow-up time appeared to be significant confounders.\nConclusions and relevance: The use of TE does not appear to increase either recurrence or mortality risk among BC survivors treated with TAM. An increased recurrence risk, without an increase in mortality, cannot be ruled out when TE is used during AI."

Depending on the animal model, subtotal PU.1 loss either induces acute myeloid leukemia or arrests early B cell and dendritic cell development. Although humans with absolute PU.1 deficiency have not been reported, a small cadre of congenital agammaglobulinemia patients with sporadic, inborn PU.1 haploinsufficiency were recently described. To better estimate the penetrance, clinical complications, immunophenotypic features, and malignancy risks of PU.1-mutated agammaglobulinemia (PU.MA), a collection of 134 novel or rare PU.1 variants from publicly available databases, institutional cohorts, previously published reports, and unsolved agammaglobulinemia cases were functionally analyzed. In total, 25 loss of function (LOF) variants were identified in 33 heterozygous carriers from 21 kindreds across 13 nations. Of subjects harboring LOF PU.1 variants, 22 were agammaglobulinemic, 5 displayed antibody deficiencies, and 6 were unaffected, indicating an estimated disease penetrance of 81.8% with variable expressivity. In a cluster of patients, disease onset was delayed, sometimes into adulthood. All LOF variants conveyed effects via haploinsufficiency, either by destabilizing PU.1, impeding nuclear localization, or directly interfering with transcription. PU.MA patient immunophenotypes consistently demonstrated B-cell, conventional dendritic-cell, and plasmacytoid dendritic-cell deficiencies. Associated infectious and non-infectious symptoms hewed closely to X-linked agammaglobulinemia and not monogenic dendritic cell deficiencies. No carriers of LOF PU.1 variants experienced hematologic malignancies. Collectively, in vitro and clinical data indicate heterozygous LOF PU.1 variants undermine humoral immunity but do not convey strong leukemic risks."

In this systematic review and meta-analysis we aim to identify the response to DDAVP, and the factors that determine DDAVP response in patients. We included studies with patients with any bleeding disorder receiving DDAVP. First and second screening round and risk of bias assessment were performed by independent reviewers. The main outcome was proportion of patients with complete (factor level > 50 U/dL), or partial (30-50 U/dL) response to DDAVP. Determinants of response including disease type, age, sex, Von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) mutations, and baseline factor levels were investigated. In total, 591 articles were found and 103 were included. Of these, 71 articles (1772 patients) were suitable for the study's definition of response. Meta-analysis showed a pooled response proportion of 0·71 [0·64;0·78] and a significant difference in response between disease subtypes. For hemophilia A, baseline FVIII:C was a borderline significant determinant of response. In von Willebrand disease (VWD) type 1 patients, VWF:Ag, VWF:Act and FVIII:C were significant determinants. A large variation in response was observed for specific mutations in VWF and F8. Response to DDAVP varied between disease subtypes, and was largely determined by the baseline levels of FVIII:C for hemophilia A and VWF:Ag for VWD. Our findings highlight the significant differences in response and emphasize the need for a standardized response definition and further research into response mechanisms."

Here, we report final overall survival (OS) at the median follow-up of 25.8 months. Patients who have previously received pertuzumab-containing regimens as first-/second-line treatment for LA/mBC were randomly assigned 1:1 to two groups, PTC group (n = 110) and TC group (n = 109). Median OS was longer in the PTC group (median OS 36.2 v 26.5 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.73 [one side 95% CI upper limit, 0.97]). Updated median investigator-assessed PFS (5.5 v 4.2 months; HR, 0.81 [one side 95% CI upper limit, 1.02]) were also better in the PTC group. Median PFS by independent review did not show the difference between the two groups (4.4 v 4.4 months; HR, 1.03 [one side 95% CI upper limit, 1.36]). These findings suggest that dual HER2 blockade with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab could contribute to improving OS in patients who have previously been treated with pertuzumab-containing regimens for HER2-positive LA/mBC."

We assessed FGFR2b protein overexpression prevalence in nearly 3,800 tumor samples as part of the prescreening process for a global phase III study in patients with newly diagnosed advanced or metastatic GC.\nMethods: As of June 28, 2024, 3,782 tumor samples from prescreened patients from 37 countries for the phase III FORTITUDE-101 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05052801) were centrally tested for FGFR2b protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and had evaluable results. FGFR2b positivity was defined as both any % tumor cells (TC) and ≥10% TC exhibiting moderate-to-strong (2+/3+) membranous FGFR2b staining. Prevalence was analyzed across patient and sample characteristics.\nResults: FGFR2b protein overexpression at any % and ≥10%, 2+/3+ TC positivity was 37.8% (1,428/3,782 [95% CI, 36.2 to 39.3]) and 16.2% (612/3,782 [95% CI, 15 to 17.4]), respectively. Of any %, 2+/3+ TC-positive tumors, 42.9% (612/1,428 [95% CI, 40.3 to 45.4]) were FGFR2b ≥10%, 2+/3+ TC positive. FGFR2b prevalence was not notably different within multiple patient and sample characteristics examined (age, sex, collection method [biopsy v resection], collection site, location of primary tumor, and geographic region).\nConclusion: As of the data cutoff date, we report the largest prevalence assessment of FGFR2b protein overexpression in GC with more than one third (37.8%) of patients with GC exhibiting FGFR2b protein overexpression (any % TC, 2+/3+) by a validated IHC assay. Approximately 16% of patients had FGFR2b protein overexpression in ≥10% of TC. FGFR2b prevalence was similar across geographic regions and within defined patient and sample variables regardless of the level of expression."

However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated this issue using Wilson's disease (WD) as a model, which is a genetic disorder characterized by impaired mitochondrial function and copper metabolism. Our retrospective clinical study found that WD patients have a significantly higher incidence of cholecystitis and a poorer prognosis. The hepatic immune cell landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing showed that the tissue immune microenvironment is altered in WD, mainly a major change in the constitution and function of the innate immune system. Exhaustion of natural killer (NK) cells is the fundamental factor, supported by the upregulated expression of inhibitory receptors and the downregulated expression of cytotoxic molecules, which was verified in clinical samples. Further bioinformatic analysis confirmed a positive correlation between NK cell exhaustion and poor prognosis in cholecystitis and other inflammatory diseases. The study demonstrated dysfunction of liver immune cells triggered by specific metabolic abnormalities in WD, with a focus on the correlation between NK cell exhaustion and poor healing of cholecystitis, providing new insights into the improvement of inflammatory diseases by assessing immune cell function."

This prospective, randomised, controlled trial (RCT) aims to investigate the efficacy of acupuncture in alleviating postoperative pain and reducing the usage of analgesic medications following anal fistula surgery.\nMethods: This single-centre, patient-blinded, assessor-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted at a tertiary referral hospital. A total of 66 patients with low simple anal fistula will be randomised at a 1:1 ratio to receive either acupuncture or sham acupuncture. The primary outcome is the difference in the numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score before and after acupuncture at 6 hours post surgery. The secondary outcomes include postoperative analgesic usage (Day 0 to Day 7), complications (including infection, urinary retention, and bleeding from Day 0 to Day 7, as well as delayed wound healing and recurrence within 3 months post surgery), sleep quality (PSQI from Day 0 to Day 7), psychological state (SDS and SAS on Day 0, Day 1, and Day 7), and overall recovery quality (QoR-15 on Day 1, Day 3, and Day 7). The statistical analysis of this trial will be conducted using SPSS software, validating the normality of data and the homogeneity of variance, and employing t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, chi-square tests, and repeated measures ANOVA to analyze baseline data, primary and secondary outcome indicators.\nDiscussion: This study aims to contribute to the expanding evidence base regarding the role of acupuncture in postoperative pain management. Through a comprehensive assessment of pain relief, analgesic usage, and other recovery-related outcomes, our findings will establish a foundation for standardizing acupuncture protocols specifically tailored for anal fistula surgery patients. The strengths of this trial are rooted in its rigorous randomised controlled trial (RCT) design, comprehensive outcome measures, and focused examination of a clinically significant issue. Ultimately, the findings of this trial have the potential to offer valuable insights into the utility of acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy for postoperative pain management among anal fistula patients, thereby informing future clinical practice and research directions.\nTrial registration: This study was registered in the China Clinical Trial Registry on June 1, 2024, with registration number: ChiCTR2400085178."

The aim of this study is to investigate the association between systemic immune inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI),pan-immune inflammation value (PIV), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and all-cause mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and to evaluate the effect of composite inflammatory markers on the prognosis of COPD patients. We obtained data on COPD patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) -IV database and divided patients into four groups based on quartiles of baseline levels of inflammatory markers, The primary outcomes were in-hospital and ICU mortality. We comprehensively explored the association between composite inflammatory markers and mortality in patients with COPD using restricted cubic splints (RCS), COX proportional hazards regression models, Kaplan-Meier curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and subgroup analyses. A total of 1234 COPD patients were included in this study. RCS results showed that SII, SIRI, PLR, PIV and NLR were positively and non-linearly correlated with the increased risk of in-hospital mortality in COPD patients. Multivariate COX regression analysis showed that compound inflammatory markers were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality in COPD patients. The KM curve results showed that COPD patients with higher SII, SIRI, PLR and PIV had a significantly lower survival probability. 5 kinds of compound between inflammatory markers and mortality in patients with COPD is related to nonlinear correlation, can increase the risk of mortality in patients with COPD is a risk factor for the prognosis of patients with COPD, and may serve as potential biomarkers for clinical COPD risk stratification and treatment management in critical patients."

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) DLI responders, we identified clonally expanded ZNF683+ CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes with in vitro specificity for patient-matched AML. These cells originated primarily from the DLI product and appeared to coordinate antitumor immune responses through interaction with diverse immune cell types within the marrow microenvironment. Nonresponders lacked this cross-talk and had cytotoxic T lymphocytes with elevated TIGIT expression. Our study identifies recipient bone marrow microenvironment differences as a determinant of an effective antileukemia response and opens opportunities to modulate cellular therapy."

However, the precise role and underlying mechanisms of palmitoylation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of macrophages remain elusive. Here, we found that M. tuberculosis infection induced the expression of zinc-finger DHHC domain-type palmitoyl-transferases (ZDHHCs), particularly ZDHHC2, in mouse macrophages. Furthermore, ZDHHC2 deficiency in mouse macrophages impaired the immunity against M. tuberculosis and reduced the production of various proinflammatory cytokines. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of ZDHHC2 in mediating the palmitoylation of B-RAF and C-RAF, affecting their autophagic degradation and stabilizing protein levels. The increased abundance of B-RAF and C-RAF subsequently increases the activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, affecting the survival of M. tuberculosis within macrophages.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly aggressive and lacks effective therapeutic options. Cancer cells frequently become more dependent on splicing factors than normal cells due to increased rates of transcription. Terminal uridylyltransferase 1 (TUT1) is a specific terminal uridylyltransferase for U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), which plays a catalytic role in the spliceosome. Here, we found that TUT1 was required for the survival of PDAC cells but not for normal pancreatic cells. In PDAC cells, the uridylylation activity of TUT1 promoted tri-snRNP assembly by facilitating the binding of LSM proteins to U6 snRNA and subsequent tri-snRNP assembly. PDAC cells required higher amounts of tri-snRNP to efficiently splice pre-mRNA with weak splice sites to support the high transcriptional output. Depletion of TUT1 in PDAC cells resulted in inefficient splicing of exons in a group of highly expressed RNAs containing weak splice sites, thereby resulting in the collapse of an mRNA processing circuit and consequently dysregulating splicing required by PDAC cells. Overall, this study unveiled an interesting function of TUT1 in regulating splicing by modulating tri-snRNP levels and demonstrated a distinct mechanism underlying splicing addiction in pancreatic cancer cells."

Enhanced understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying iCCA tumorigenesis and the discovery of appropriate therapeutic targets are imperative to improve patient outcomes. Here, we investigated the functions and regulations of solute carrier family 16 member 3 (SLC16A3), which has been reported to be a biomarker of poor prognosis in iCCA. High SLC16A3 expression was enriched in KRAS-mutated iCCA tumors, and mutant KRAS elevated SLC16A3 expression via the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1/HIF1α pathway. SLC16A3 not only enhanced glycolysis but also induced epigenetic reprogramming to regulate iCCA progression. Phosphorylation of SLC16A3 at S436 (p-S436) was vital for its oncogenic function and was linked to iCCA progression. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) directly phosphorylated SLC16A3 at S436, and CK2 inhibition with CX-4945 (silmitasertib) reduced the growth of KRAS-mutated iCCA tumor xenografts and patient-derived organoids. Together, this study provides valuable insights into the diverse functions of SLC16A3 in iCCA and comprehensively elucidates the upstream regulatory mechanisms, providing potential therapeutic strategies for iCCA patients with KRAS mutations."

    "abstract": "Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by immune-mediated destruction of gastric parietal cells, leading to oxyntic atrophy, achlorhydria, and hypergastrinemia. While AIG was historically linked to gastric adenocarcinoma and type I neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), recent evidence suggests the risk of adenocarcinoma in AIG is lower than previously believed, particularly in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-negative patients. The increased cancer risk in AIG is mainly attributed to concurrent or past H. pylori infection. The incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma in AIG ranges from 0.12% to 0.5% per year, with cumulative risks over 10 years reported at 1%-3%. In contrast, type I NETs are more commonly associated with AIG, with an annual incidence of 0.68%-2.8% and cumulative rates as high as 15.3% over five years. Adenomatous polyps, which can progress to malignancy, have been reported in 4.6%-13.6% of AIG patients. This review examines the immune and molecular mechanisms underlying AIG's pathogenesis, positioning it as a model of immune-mediated epithelial injury with limited carcinogenic potential. AIG is associated with reparative metaplastic phenotypes, such as pseudopyloric and complete intestinal metaplasia, which contrast with the more aggressive incomplete intestinal metaplasia observed in H. pylori-induced gastritis. The reduced risk of adenocarcinoma in AIG is attributed to the absence of H. pylori, a T cell-dominated microenvironment, minimal macrophage infiltration, and protective factors such as altered gastric microbiota, epigenetic modifications, increased CD3+ intraepithelial cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and reduced interleukin-33/interleukin-13 signaling. Although AIG is linked to preneoplastic changes, its primary neoplastic risks include the development of type I NETs and adenomatous polyps, which carry a potential for malignant transformation, necessitating long-term surveillance in patients with hypergastrinemia, extensive atrophy, and associated gastric lesions. Challenges persist in distinguishing AIG from other atrophic gastritis types due to limitations in serological and histological markers, but emerging diagnostic tools, such as lymphocyte profiling and molecular assays, promise improved accuracy. This review underscores the importance of tailored surveillance and management strategies to address the distinct neoplastic risks associated with AIG, while advocating for further research into its immune landscape and molecular pathways."

These Aβ aggregates are increasingly successfully targeted with clinical therapies at later stages of the disease, but the fundamental molecular steps in early stage disease that trigger the initial nucleation event leading to the conversion of monomeric Aβ peptide into pathological aggregates remain unknown. Here, we show that the Aβ peptide can form biomolecular condensates on lipid bilayers both in molecular assays and in living cells. Our results reveal that these Aβ condensates can significantly accelerate the primary nucleation step in the amyloid conversion cascade that leads to the formation of amyloid aggregates. We show that Aβ condensates contain phospholipids, are intrinsically heterogeneous, and are prone to undergo a liquid-to-solid transition leading to the formation of amyloid fibrils. These findings uncover the liquid-liquid phase separation behavior of the Aβ peptide and reveal a molecular step very early in the amyloid-β aggregation process."

We summarize key seminal and recent findings that elucidate how obesity influences immune function, spanning its classical role in microbial defense, its contribution to maladaptive inflammatory diseases such as asthma, and its impact on antitumor immunity. We also explore how obesity modulates immune function within tissue parenchyma, with a particular focus on the role of T cells in adipose tissue. Finally, we consider areas for future research, including investigation of the durable aspects of obesity on immunological function even after weight loss, such as those observed with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist treatment.

Moreover, it has shed light on the pathways through which most anticancer therapeutics induce tumor cell death, including targeted therapy and immunotherapy. These mechanistic studies have paved the way for the development of therapeutics directly targeting either pro- or antiapoptotic proteins. Notably, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in 2016, with additional agents currently undergoing clinical trials. Recent research has brought to the forefront both the anti- and proinflammatory effects of individual apoptotic pathways.

Recent clinical trials have indicated that gut microbiome modulation using probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) led to improvements in multiple symptoms related to PACS, including fatigue, memory loss, difficulty in concentration, gastrointestinal upset, and disturbances in sleep and mood. In this review, we highlight the latest evidence on the key microbial alterations observed in PACS, as well as the use of microbiome-based therapeutics in managing PACS symptoms. These novel findings altogether shed light on the treatment of PACS and other chronic conditions."

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is the most common cerebrovascular disease and the leading cause of permanent disability worldwide. Recent studies have shown that stroke development and prognosis are closely related to abnormal tryptophan metabolism. Here, significant downregulation of 3-hydroxy-kynurenamine (3-HKA) in stroke patients and animal models is identified. Supplementation with 3-HKA improved long-term neurological recovery, reduced infarct volume, and increased ipsilateral cerebral blood flow after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). 3-HKA promoted angiogenesis, functional blood vessel formation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) repair. Moreover, 3-HKA inhibited A1-like (neurotoxic) astrocyte activation but promoted A2-like (neuroprotective) astrocyte polarization. Proteomic analysis revealed that 3-HKA inhibited AIM2 inflammasome activation after stroke, and co-labeling studies indicated that AIM2 expression typically increased in astrocytes at 7 and 14 days after stroke. Consistently, in co-cultures of primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes, 3-HKA promoted angiogenesis after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). AIM2 overexpression in astrocytes abrogated 3-HKA-driven vascular remodeling in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that 3-HKA may regulate astrocyte-mediated vascular remodeling by impeding AIM2 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, 3-HKA may promote post-stroke vascular remodeling by regulating A1/A2 astrocyte activation, thereby improving long-term neurological recovery, suggesting that supplementation with 3-HKA may be an efficient therapy for stroke."

    "abstract": "Importance: Black and Hispanic women in the US experience higher incidence rates of aggressive molecular subtypes of breast cancer, including triple-negative disease. However, how these rates are changing, particularly across different age groups, has not been well documented.\nObjective: To assess changes in overall and subtype-specific breast cancer incidence rates in the US by age and race and ethnicity.\nDesign, setting, and participants: This cohort study used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program cancer registry data from 22 US cancer registries on 1 123 658 females who received a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer from 2010 to 2019. Statistical analysis was conducted from August 2023 to October 2024.\nExposures: Age and race and ethnicity.\nMain outcomes and measures: Age-adjusted incidence rates of invasive breast cancer overall and across the 4 major molecular subtypes by age and by race and ethnicity, as well as their associated annual percentage changes using Joinpoint Trend Analysis software.\nResults: Of the 1 123 658 participants in the study, 219 112 (19.5%) were younger than 50 years, 409 257 (36.4%) were aged 50 to 64 years, and 495 289 (44.1%) were 65 years or older. A total of 141 703 participants (12.6%) were Hispanic, 3253 (0.3%) were non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native, 78 306 (7.0%) were non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, 124 560 (11.1%) were non-Hispanic Black, 769 043 (68.4%) were non-Hispanic White, and 6793 participants (0.6%) had an unknown race and/or ethnicity. Overall, breast cancer incidence rates increased 0.5% per year from 2010 to 2019. Variation by race and ethnicity was observed, with increases of 1.4% per year among Hispanic females, 1.9% per year among non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native females, and 2.1% per year among non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander females, while rates increased only 0.8% per year among non-Hispanic Black females and 0.5% per year among non-Hispanic White females. In subtype analyses, increases of the greatest magnitude in recent years were observed in the incidence rates of triple-negative breast cancer per year among participants aged 65 years or older (Hispanic females, 2.3%; non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander females, 5.5%; and non-Hispanic Black females, 4.3%), while remaining unchanged among non-Hispanic White females.\nConclusions and relevance: In this cohort study of 1 123 658 females with breast cancer over the 10-year period from 2010 to 2019, there were substantial differences in trends in the incidence rates of breast cancer overall and by subtype across different racial and ethnic groups. Further research is needed to understand the factors associated with these trends."

    "heading": "Tau Pathology Drives Disease-Associated Astrocyte Reactivity in Salt-Induced Neurodegeneration",
    "abstract": "Dietary high salt intake is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have identified a population of disease-associated astrocytes (DAA)-like astrocytes closely linked to amyloid deposition and tau pathology in an AD mouse model. However, the presence and role of these astrocytes in high-salt diet (HSD) models remain unexplored. In this study, it is demonstrated that HSD significantly induces enhanced reactivity of DAA-like astrocytes in the hippocampal CA3 region of mice, with this reactivity being critically dependent on neuronal tau pathology. Neuronal tau pathology activates adenosine A1R signaling, exacerbating tau pathology by inhibiting the Cers1 pathway, which sustains astrocyte reactivity. Additionally, neurons burdened with tau pathology promote astrocyte reactivity via releasing Proteins Associated with Promoting DAA-like Astrocyte Reactivity (PAPD), with Lcn2 playing a pivotal role. Knockout of Lcn2 or its receptor 24p3R significantly mitigates HSD-induced DAA reactivity and neuroinflammation. These findings suggest a vicious cycle between tau pathology and A1R signaling, driving DAA-like astrocyte reactivity. Targeting the Tau-A1R axis may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for reducing HSD-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits."

    "abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are commonly considered accomplices in tumorigenesis and tumor development. However, the precise mechanism by which tumor cells prompt TAMs to aid in evading immune surveillance remains to be further investigated. Here, it is elucidated that tumor-secreted galectin-1 (Gal1) conferred immunosuppressive properties to TAMs. Specifically, patient specimens and a public database is first used to analyze the clinical relevance of Gal1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Then, it is demonstrated that TAMs functioned as a critical mediator in the Gal1-induced progression of HCC and the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing determined that Gal1 promoted the upregulation of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) in TAMs via activating the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway. Employing an anti-CCL20 neutralizing antibody and Foxp3DTR mice, it is demonstrated that CCR6+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) recruited by Gal1-induced TAMs contributed to reduced infiltration and dysfunctional state of CD8+ T cells, subsequently facilitating tumor progression. Targeting Gal1 dampened the secretion of CCL20 and inhibits the recruitment of Tregs, thereby activating anti-tumor immunity and ameliorating anti-PD-1 resistance. Together, this findings revealed that Gal1-induced TAMs recruited Tregs through the CCL20-CCR6 axis. Inhibition of Gal1 improves the effectiveness of anti-PD1 therapy, shedding important new light on the combination immunotherapy of HCC."

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is an age-related degenerative joint disease, prominently influenced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). Although elevated IL-6 levels in joint fluid are well-documented, the uneven cartilage degeneration observed in knee OA patients suggests additional underlying mechanisms. This study investigates the role of interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) in mediating IL-6 signaling and its contribution to OA progression. Here, significantly elevated IL-6R expression is identified in degenerated cartilage of OA patients. Further, in vivo experiments reveal that intra-articular injection of recombinant IL-6R protein or activation of gp130 (Y757F mutation) accelerates OA progression. Conversely, knockout of IL-6R or JAK2, as well as treatment with a JAK inhibitor, alleviates OA symptoms. Mechanistically, chondrocytes derived from degenerative cartilage exhibit impaired nuclear localization of SOX9, a key regulator of cartilage homeostasis. JAK inhibition stabilizes SIRT1, reduces SOX9 acetylation, and thereby facilitates SOX9 nuclear localization, promoting cartilage repair. Additionally, the JAK inhibitor-induced apoptosis in p21-positive senescent cells, and their targeted clearance successfully alleviates OA in p21-3MR mice. In conclusion, these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which inhibiting the IL-6R/JAK2 pathway can alleviate OA. Furthermore, this study proposes targeting p21-positive senescent cells as a new therapeutic strategy for OA."

    "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with well-established metabolic risk factors, especially hyperlipidemia and obesity. Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (mIRI) significantly offsets the therapeutic efficacy of revascularization. Previous studies indicated that disrupted lipid homeostasis can lead to lipid peroxidation damage and inflammation, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, the study demonstrates that hyperlipidemia is a key driver of mIRI. Long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) is upregulated in both hyperlipidemia and AMI patients. ACSL1 expression is induced by a high-fat microenvironment (oxLDL and palmitic acid) in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, the protein level is positively correlated with total cholesterol level and thromboinflammatory biomarkers. Furthermore, ACSL1 reprogrammed lipid metabolism in monocytes, leading to the accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)/lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). The monocytic LPC/LPA axis accelerated lipid peroxidation and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)-induced thromboinflammation via the paracrine effect. The main LPA producer Autotaxinis is also induced under high-fat conditions and then exerts thromboinflammation response through converted LPC to LPA. Finally, ACSL1 knockdown or NETs release inhibitor (DNase I or GSK484) significantly alleviated mIRI in mice. These findings highlight ACSL1 and NETosis as potential key targets for preventing mIRI and underscore the lipid peroxidation in the mechanisms of ACSL1-mediated thromboinflammation."

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses a continual therapeutic challenge owing to its elevated incidence and unfavourable prognosis, underscoring the critical need for the discovery of new molecular targets for detection and therapy. This work included the analysis of three publically accessible HCC datasets from TCGA and GEO. Instrumental variables (IVs) were derived via expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis, then followed by two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis utilising publically available summary statistics. Key disease-associated genes were identified by assessing odds ratios and connecting them with differentially expressed genes across the datasets. The potential molecular mechanisms of these genes were clarified by functional enrichment analysis, clinical data analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing, GSEA, immune cell infiltration, and immune checkpoint analysis. These findings were then confirmed by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative PCR. By synthesising the outcomes from differential analysis of the databases, we found two genes, SERPING1 and STEAP3, that may be crucial in the beginning and development of HCC. These genes have a role in vital biological pathways and functions, such as metabolic regulation and macrophage activation. The significance of immunological-mediated processes in HCC was further highlighted by CIBERSORT analysis, which revealed a specific pattern of immune cell infiltration and the location of immunological checkpoints in the illness. The findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms of HCC and underscore critical genes implicated in its pathogenesis. SERPING1 and STEAP3 affect tumour cells and modify the tumour microenvironment (TME), indicating that targeting these genes may offer a viable immunotherapeutic approach for HCC in clinical settings."

Here, we aimed to identify metabolites associated with bortezomib (Btz)-related toxicities and response to treatment in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM).\nMethods: Fifty-four plasma samples from transplant-ineligible MM patients enrolled in a randomized phase II study comparing two less-intensive regimens of melphalan, prednisolone and Btz (MPB) were subjected to the lipidomic profiling analysis. The amount of each lipid metabolite in plasma obtained prior to MPB therapy was compared to toxicity grades and responses to MPB therapy.\nResults: High levels of 7 phospholipids (4 lysophosphatidylcholines and 3 phosphatidylcholines) were observed in cases with Btz-induced ≥ grade 2 peripheral neuropathy (BiPN) (n = 11). In addition, low levels of 3 fatty acids (FAs)-FA (18:2), FA (18:1), and FA (22:6)-were observed in patients who developed severe skin disorders ≥ grade 2 (n = 10). No metabolite significantly associated with treatment response was identified.\nConclusion: We conclude that levels of specific plasma lipid metabolites are associated with the severity of BiPN and skin disorders in patients with MM. These metabolites may serve as candidate biomarkers to predict Btz-induced toxicity in patients with MM before initiating Btz-containing therapy."

    "abstract": "Engineered extracellular vesicles play an increasingly important role in the treatment of spinal cord injury. In order to prepare more effective engineered extracellular vesicles, we biologically modified M2 microglia. Angiopep-2 (Ang2) is an oligopeptide that can target the blood-brain barrier. Through single-cell sequencing and immunofluorescence experiments, we confirmed that the expression of LRP-1, the targeted receptor of Ang2, was elevated after spinal cord injury. Subsequently, we integrated the Ang2 peptide segment into M2 microglia to obtain Ang2-EVs, which could successfully target the site of spinal cord injury. However, in order to improve the function of Ang2-EVs, we pretreated M2 microglia with melatonin, which has anti-inflammatory effects, to obtain M-Ang2-EVs. The results of single-nucleus sequencing of the mouse spinal cord verified that neurons and OPCs gradually transformed into subtypes related to nerve repair functions after treatment with M-Ang2-EVs. This is consistent with the sequencing and enrichment analysis of miRNAs contained in M-Ang2-EVs. We further verified through experiments that M-Ang2-EVs can promote microglia/macrophages to phagocytose sphingomyelin, promote axon remyelination and axon elongation, and maintain the integrity of the blood-spinal barrier. Since Ang2 can also target the blood-brain barrier, we found that M-Ang2-EVs can also reduce brain inflammation that results from spinal cord injury. Our study applied the Angiopep-2 peptide to spinal cord injury to enhance the targeting of injured cells, and successfully construct engineered extracellular vesicles that can target the spinal cord injury site and the brain."

The diagnosis is often made late, with mortality reaching 90% when mechanical ventilation is needed. We sought to develop and validate a risk prediction model for the diagnosis of IPA.\nMethods: We used two independent datasets of immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure admitted to 12 intensive care units (ICUs). The derivation dataset include 3262 patients. Factors associated with probable or proven IPA were identified, and a risk prediction model was developed. This model was then validated in a prospective dataset (776 patients).\nResults: IPA prevalence was 4.5% (146/3262) and 3.3% (26/776), in the derivation and the validation cohorts, respectively. The final model included eight variables constitutive of the IPA-GRRR-OH score: type of immunosuppression, high-dose or long-term corticosteroids, neutropenia, the presence of structural lung disease, time from symptoms onset to ICU admission > 7 days, hemoptysis, focal alveolar pattern on the chest imaging, and viral co-infection. The median score [IQR] was 2 [1-3] in the derivation and 1 [0-3] in the validation cohort. The best cutoff score for IPA diagnosis was 4 (sensitivity 23.1%; specificity 90.5%; negative predictive value 91.4%). Discrimination and calibration were good in both the derivation (AUC 0.72 [0.68-0.76]) and the validation cohort (AUC 0.85 [0.76-0.93]).\nConclusion: The IPA-GRRR-OH is a clinical score, easily available at ICU admission, which reliably predicts IPA in immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure. Studies to demonstrate benefits from the bedside implementation of this score are warranted."

In addition to its clear prognostic importance, MRD information is increasingly used in clinical decision algorithms to guide therapeutic interventions. While it is well-established that achievement of MRD-negative remission is an important endpoint of ALL therapy, the prognostic and therapeutic implications of MRD in an individual patient are influenced by both disease-related factors (e.g. cytomolecular risk) and assay-related factors (e.g. sensitivity, specimen source, and timing of assessment), which add complexity to MRD-guided treatment decisions. In this review, we discuss the data supporting the use of MRD assessment in adult ALL and how this information can rationally inform clinical decisions, including selection of patients for MRD-directed therapies or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We also discuss important interpretative challenges related to novel high sensitivity next-generation sequencing-based MRD assays, which are becoming increasingly used in clinical practice."

Here, we show that lysosomal RNA stress, caused by the lack of RNase T2, induces macrophage accumulation in multiple organs such as the spleen and liver through TLR13 activation by microbiota-derived ribosomal RNAs. TLR13 triggered emergency myelopoiesis, increasing the number of myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow and spleen. Splenic macrophages continued to proliferate and mature into macrophages expressing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In the liver, TLR13 activated monocytes/macrophages to proliferate and mature into monocyte-derived KCs (moKCs), in which, the liver X receptor (LXR) was activated. In accumulated moKCs, tissue clearance genes such as MerTK, AXL, and apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM) were highly expressed, while TLR-dependent production of proinflammatory cytokines was impaired. Consequently, Rnaset2-/- mice were resistant to acute liver injuries elicited by acetaminophen (APAP) and LPS with D-galactosamine. These findings suggest that TLR13 activated by lysosomal RNA stress promotes the replenishment of tissue-protective Kupffer cells."

Here, we report gene mutation data from paired baseline and PD peripheral blood samples from 52 patients (zanubrutinib, n=24; ibrutinib, n=28) who, at an early median follow-up time of 25.7 months, progressed on zanubrutinib or ibrutinib treatment in the ALPINE trial (NCT03734016). No BTK mutations were observed at baseline; at PD, eight patients (zanubrutinib, n=5, ibrutinib, n=3) acquired a total of 17 BTK mutations. Among BTK mutations, 82.4% (zanubrutinib, n=11/14; ibrutinib, n=3/3) were at C481. Non-C481 mutations were detected in 12.5% (3/24) of zanubrutinib-treated patients (L528W: n=2, cancer cell fraction [CCF]=9.58% and 17.6%; A428D, n=1, CCF=37.03%); these were not detected in ibrutinib-treated patients. At baseline, 48/52 patients had ≥1 driver gene mutation/s, most frequently in: NOTCH1 (n=21), TP53 (n=19), BRAF (n=10), SF3B1 (n=8), and ATM (n=8). At PD, acquired driver gene mutations were observed in one zanubrutinib-treated patient (TP53, XPO1) and five ibrutinib-treated patients (TP53, n=1 patient; SETD2, n=1; SF3B1, n=1; ASXL1, n=2). Baseline driver gene mutations were not associated with later development of BTK mutations, but patients with ≥2 baseline driver gene mutations were more likely to acquire BTK mutations at PD. In conclusion, patients in this data set had a short treatment duration and a low incidence of BTK mutations, suggesting that mechanisms other than BTK/PLCG2 mutations are driving most instances of early PD.

Several HSCT centers decline to perform HSCT for patients with TP53 mutation because of poor outcomes. In this study, we analyzed 240 patients with TP53-mutated myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that underwent HSCT. We aimed to identify the patients that benefit most from HSCT. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). Fifty-two percent of the cohort had AML and the median age of the cohort was 62. AML and MDS outcomes were similar. We identified several favorable prognostic factors for PFS including the absence of complex cytogenetics/5q deletion/7q deletion, a lower variant allele frequency (VAF), a mono-hit status and the use of a matched-related donor. Using classification and regression tree analysis, we identified VAF and cytogenetics as the two most important prognostic factors. Patients with TP53mut VAF ≥ 50% had a 2-year PFS of 3%, patients with TP53mut VAF < 50% and complex/5q/7q cytogenetics abnormalities had 2-year PFS of 22%. Patients with TP53mut VAF < 50% and without complex/5q/7q cytogenetics had 2-year PFS of 60%. This data informs clinical practice and helps patients decide whether to pursue HSCT."

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly metastatic subtype of breast cancer. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is a nonbinary process in the metastatic cascade that generates tumor cells with both epithelial and mesenchymal traits known as hybrid EM cells. Recent studies have elucidated the enhanced metastatic potential of cancers featuring the hybrid EM phenotype, highlighting the need to uncover molecular drivers and targetable vulnerabilities of the hybrid EM state. Here, we discovered that hybrid EM breast tumors are enriched in CD38, an immunosuppressive molecule associated with worse clinical outcomes in liquid malignancies. Altering CD38 expression in tumor cell impacted migratory, invasive, and metastatic capabilities of hybrid EM cells. Abrogation of CD38 expression stimulated an antitumor immune response, thereby preventing the generation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment in hybrid EM tumors. CD38 levels positively correlated with PD-L1 expression in samples from patients with TNBC. Moreover, targeting CD38 potentiated the activity of anti-PD-L1, eliciting strong antitumor immunity, with reduced tumor growth in hybrid EM models. Overall, this research exposes upregulation of CD38 as a specific survival strategy utilized by hybrid EM breast tumors to suppress immune cell activity and sustain metastasis, with strong implications in other carcinomas that have hybrid EM properties. Significance: Hybrid cells co-featuring epithelial and mesenchymal traits in triple-negative breast cancer express elevated levels of CD38 to induce immunosuppression and metastasis, indicating CD38 inhibition as potential strategy for treating breast cancer."

This study aimed to identify and evaluate the efficacy of a novel influenza universal vaccine candidate consisting of multiple polypeptides derived from highly conserved regions of influenza virus proteins hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix protein 2 (M2).\nMethods: Immunoinformatics tools were used to screen conserved epitopes from different influenza virus subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, H9N2, and IBV). A polypeptide vaccine, P125-H, was constructed by linking multiple epitopes using Ii-Key technology. The immunogenicity of P125-H was assessed in mice using MF59-adjuvanted P125-H via intraperitoneal injection. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neutralizing antibody responses were measured, along with IFN-γ levels in spleen lymphocytes. Protective efficacy was evaluated using viral challenge with lethal doses of H1N1 and H7N9.\nResults: Mice immunized with P125-H generated high levels of HI and neutralizing antibodies against multiple influenza strains. IFN-γ production was significantly elevated in spleen lymphocytes upon stimulation with the vaccine. P125-H protected mice from influenza infection, reducing weight loss and the viral load in the lungs, mitigating lung pathology, and decreasing mortality.\nConclusions: The P125-H vaccine induced broad cross-protection against multiple influenza strains and elicited robust immune responses. It demonstrates strong potential as a candidate for a universal influenza vaccine."

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe motor neuron disease, with most sporadic cases lacking clear genetic causes. Abnormal pre-mRNA splicing is a fundamental mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases. For example, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) loss-of-function (LOF) causes widespread RNA mis-splicing events in ALS. Additionally, splicing mutations are major contributors to neurological disorders. However, the role of intronic variants driving RNA mis-splicing in ALS remains poorly understood. To address this, we developed Spliformer to predict RNA splicing. Spliformer is a transformer-based deep learning model trained and tested on splicing events from the GENCODE database, as well as RNA-seq data from blood and central nervous system tissues. We benchmarked Spliformer against SpliceAI and Pangolin using testing datasets and paired whole-genome sequencing (WGS) with RNA-seq data. We further developed the Spliformer-motif model to identify splicing regulatory motifs. We analyzed Clinvar dataset to identify the link of splicing variants with disease pathogenicity. Additionally, we analyzed WGS data of ALS patients and controls to identify common intronic splicing variants linked to ALS risk or disease phenotypes. We also profiled rare intronic splicing variants in ALS patients to identify known or novel ALS-associated genes. Minigene assays were employed to validate candidate splicing variants. Finally, we measured spine density in neurons with a specific gene knockdown or those expressing a TDP-43 disease-causing mutant. Spliformer accurately predicts the possibilities of a nucleotide within a pre-mRNA sequence being a splice donor, acceptor, or neither. Spliformer outperformed SpliceAI and Pangolin in both speed and accuracy in tested splicing events and/or paired WGS/RNA-seq data. Spliformer-motif successfully identified canonical and novel splicing regulatory motifs. In Clinvar dataset, splicing variants are highly related to disease pathogenicity. Genome-wide analyses of common intronic splicing variants nominated one variant linked to ALS progression. Deep learning analyses of WGS data from 1,370 ALS patients revealed rare splicing variants in reported ALS genes (such as PTPRN2 and CFAP410, validated through minigene assays and RNA-seq), and TDP-43 LOF related RNA mis-splicing genes (such as PTPRD). Further genetic analysis and minigene assays nominated PCP4 and TMEM63A as ALS-associated genes. Functional assays demonstrated that PCP4 is critical for maintaining spine density and can rescue spine loss in neurons expressing a disease-causing TDP-43 mutant. In summary, we developed Spliformer and Spliformer-motif that accurately predict and interpret pre-mRNA splicing. Our findings highlight an intronic genetic mechanism driving RNA mis-splicing in ALS and nominate PCP4 as an ALS-associated gene."

    "heading": "Exerkines and Sarcopenia: Unveiling the Mechanism Behind Exercise-Induced Mitochondrial Homeostasis",
    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Sarcopenia, characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, is linked to physical disability, metabolic dysfunction, and an increased risk of mortality. Exercise therapy is currently acknowledged as a viable approach for addressing sarcopenia. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms behind exercise training or physical activity remain poorly understood. The disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis is implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia. Exercise training effectively delays the onset of sarcopenia by significantly maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, including promoting mitophagy, improving mitochondrial biogenesis, balancing mitochondrial dynamics, and maintaining mitochondrial redox. Exerkines (e.g., adipokines, myokines, hepatokines, and osteokines), signaling molecules released in response to exercise training, may potentially contribute to skeletal muscle metabolism through ameliorating mitochondrial homeostasis, reducing inflammation, and regulating protein synthesis as a defense against sarcopenia. Methods: In this review, we provide a detailed summary of exercise-induced exerkines and confer their benefit, with particular focus on their impact on mitochondrial homeostasis in the context of sarcopenia. Results: Exercise induces substantial adaptations in skeletal muscle, including increased muscle mass, improved muscle regeneration and hypertrophy, elevated hormone release, and enhanced mitochondrial function. An expanding body of research highlights that exerkines have the potential to regulate processes such as mitophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, autophagy, and redox balance. These mechanisms contribute to the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis, thereby supporting skeletal muscle metabolism and mitochondrial health. Conclusions: Through a comprehensive investigation of the molecular mechanisms within mitochondria, the context reveals new insights into the potential of exerkines as key exercise-protective sensors for combating sarcopenia."

    "abstract": "Introduction: The optimal treatment of estrogen receptor-positive (ER +) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) after progression on cyclin-dependent 4/6 kinase inhibitors (CDK4/6i) is unknown.\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of phase-II/-III randomized trials of ER + MBC post CDK4/6i + ET progression. We calculated the hazard ratio (HR) for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) using generic inverse variance and odds ratios (ORs) using the Mantel-Haenszel method for adverse events (AEs) with Review-Manager version-5.4. NMA was executed using WINBUGS (Microsoft Excel). Three molecular subgroups were analyzed: HER2-low, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and the ESR1 mutation subgroup for selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD).\nResults: A total of 14 studies were included. In the HER2-low group, Sacituzumab govitecan and trastuzumab deruxtecan had a similar efficacy (HR, 95% CI): PFS (0.98; 0.63-1.43) and OS (1.08; 0.76-1.55). In PI3K/AKT/mTOR-altered cases, capivasertib was superior to alpelisib PFS (0.77; 0.53-1.12), and OS (0.80; 0.48-1.35). SERDs had worse PFS and OS versus ongoing CDK 4/6i (ribociclib).\nConclusion: No therapy emerged as the unequivocal choice in the post-CDK 4/6i domain in unselected subgroups. In the HER2-low population, a similar efficacy and different toxicity spectrum was seen. In AKT-altered tumors, capivasertib was less toxic than alpelisib.\nProspero id: CRD4202236412."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are increasingly used for preclinical and clinical cardiac gene therapy approaches. However, gene transfer to cardiomyocytes poses a challenge due to differences between AAV serotypes in terms of expression efficiency in vitro and in vivo. For example, AAV9 vectors work well in rodent heart muscle cells in vivo but not in cultivated neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVCMs), necessitating the use of AAV6 vectors for in vitro studies. Therefore, we aimed to develop an AAV that could efficiently express genes in NRVCMs, human engineered heart tissue (hEHT), and mammalian hearts. The production of AAV6 vectors results in lower yields compared with AAV9. Hence, we used random AAV9 peptide libraries and selected variants on NRVCMs at the vector genome and RNA levels in parallel. The enriched library variants were characterized using high-throughput analysis of barcoded variants, followed by individual validation of the most promising candidates. Interestingly, we found striking differences in NRVCM transduction and gene expression patterns of the AAV capsid variants depending on the selection strategy. AAV variants selected based on the vector genome level enabled the highest transduction but were outperformed by AAVs selected on the RNA level in terms of expression efficiency. In addition, we identified a new AAV9 capsid variant that not only allowed significantly higher gene expression in NRVCMs compared with AAV6 but also enabled similar gene expression in murine hearts as AAV9 wild-type vectors after being intravenously injected into mice. Moreover, the novel variant facilitated significantly higher gene expression in hEHT compared with AAV9. Therefore, this AAV variant could streamline preclinical gene therapy studies of myocardial diseases by eliminating the need for using different AAVs for NRVCMs, hEHT, and mice."

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent and deadly malignancies worldwide. Recently, ferroptosis, a novel form of regulated cell death characterized by iron dependency and lipid peroxidation, has garnered significant attention from researchers. The mechanisms underlying ferroptosis, including intracellular iron levels, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant system regulation, offer new insights into cancer treatment strategies. This study aims to explore the emerging role of ferroptosis in the context of immunotherapy for CRC, highlighting its potential mechanisms and clinical applications. We employed a comprehensive review of current literature to elucidate the biological mechanisms of ferroptosis, its relationship with CRC, and the interplay between ferroptosis and immunotherapy. Ferroptosis reshapes the tumor microenvironment (TME) by regulating intracellular iron levels, lipid metabolism, and antioxidant systems, significantly enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Meanwhile, traditional Chinese medicine therapies promote antitumor immunity by modulating the TME and inducing ferroptosis. Additionally, advances in nanotechnology have facilitated precise therapy by enabling targeted delivery of ferroptosis inducers or immunomodulators, transforming \"cold\" tumors into \"hot\" tumors and further boosting ICI efficacy. This study comprehensively reviews the latest developments in ferroptosis, immunotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine, and nanotechnology in CRC, highlighting the importance of ferroptosis-related biomarkers and novel inducers for personalized treatment. In summary, ferroptosis offers a promising strategy to overcome CRC therapy resistance and enhance immunotherapy efficacy, warranting further investigation and translational application."

    "abstract": "Rationale: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a clinical syndrome associated with a multitude of conditions. Although renal replacement therapy (RRT) remains the cornerstone of treatment for advanced AKI, its implementation can potentially pose risks and may not be readily accessible across all healthcare settings and regions. Elevated lactate levels are implicated in sepsis-induced AKI; however, it remains unclear whether increased lactate directly induces AKI or elucidates the underlying mechanisms.\nMethods: For human, the measurement of lactate in arterial blood gas is performed using the direct determination of L-lactate through an electrode oxidation method by a blood gas analyzer. For mice, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were employed to quantify the concentrations of lactate and AKI biomarkers in blood and cell supernatant. The mouse model of AKI was performed with a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of lactate (30 mg/kg) and low-dose LPS (2 mg/kg) for 24 h. Proteomic analysis was conducted to identify lactylated proteins in kidney tissues. Techniques such as, immunoprecipitation, western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate the levels of HMGB1 lactylation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)and to assess related molecular signaling pathways.\nMain results: Our findings indicate that lactate serves as an independent predictor of AKI in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). We observed that co-administration of lactate with low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in lactate overproduction, which subsequently elevated serum levels of creatinine (Cre) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Furthermore, the combined application of lactate and low-dose LPS was shown to provoke HMGB1 lactylation within renal tissues. Notably, pretreatment with HMGB1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively diminished lactate-mediated HMGB1 lactylation and alleviated the severity of AKI. Additionally, lactate accumulation was found to enhance the expression levels of NETs in the bloodstream, with circulating NETs levels positively correlating with HMGB1 lactylation. Importantly, pre-administration of HMGB1 inhibitors (glycyrrhizin) or lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) inhibitors (oxamate) reversed the upregulation of NETs induced by lactate and low-dose LPS in both the blood and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) cell supernatant, thereby ameliorating AKI associated with lactate accumulation.\nConclusions: These findings illuminate the role of lactate-mediated HMGB1 lactylation in inducing AKI in mice through the activation of the HMGB1-NETs signaling pathway."

Specifically, hepatobiliary disorders, renal and urinary disorders, and metabolic and nutritional disorders were found to be characteristic adverse reactions associated with tolvaptan. Additionally, uncommon but notable ADE signals were observed, such as renal cyst rupture, renal cyst infection, polycystic liver disease, and renal cyst hemorrhage. These several ADEs have not been referred to in the previous literature. Notably, strong ADE signals were detected for decreased urine osmolality [n = 5, ROR 149.74, PRR 149.7, IC (Information Component) 7.13, EBGM (Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean) 139.79], osmotic demyelination syndrome (n = 38, ROR 128.47, PRR 128.25, IC 6.92, EBGM 120.91), and pulmonary-related tumors such as bronchial metastatic carcinoma, bronchial carcinoma, metastatic small cell lung carcinoma, and small cell lung carcinoma. In the concomitant medication analysis of 7,486 suspected adverse drug reaction reports related to tolvaptan, the top three drugs most commonly used in combination with tolvaptan were furosemide, spironolactone, and amlodipine.\nConclusion: While tolvaptan provides therapeutic benefits, it poses a risk of significant adverse reactions. Clinicians should closely monitor the occurrence of events related to hepatobiliary disorders, renal and urinary disorders, metabolic and nutritional disorders, as well as benign, malignant, and indeterminate tumors during its clinical use."

The current study was conducted to assess real-world adverse events (AEs) associated with eculizumab through data mining of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).\nMethods: Disproportionality analyses, including Reporting Ratio Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS) algorithms were used to quantify the signals of eculizumab-associated AEs.\nResults: A total of 46,316 eculizumab-related ADEs reports were identified by analyzing 19,418,776 reports in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. A total of 461 PTs were identified as satisfying by all four algorithms. These PTs reported adverse reactions consistent with the specifications, such as fatigue, nasopharyngitis, meningococcal infection, fever, and anemia. Some PTs, such as aplastic anemia, gene mutation, mastication disorder, kidney fibrosis, BK virus infection, abnormal neutrophil count, C3 glomerulopathy, neuroblastoma, and glomerulonephritis membranoproliferative, were also detected outside the instructions. The median time to onset of eculizumab adverse events was 159 days (interquartile range [IQR] 11∼738 days). In addition, at the PT level, 51 PTs were determined to have an imbalance in the occurrence of ADEs between the sexes.\nConclusion: These findings provide valuable insights into the occurrence of ADEs following the use of eculizumab and could support clinical monitoring and risk identification efforts."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate this relationship.\nMethods: We performed a two-sample mendelian randomization(MR) analysis to examine the causal effect of TyG index on endometriosis, and inverse variance weighting(IVW) was the main method of analysis. Then, we selected 1484 participants with endometriosis from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2006. Weighted multivariable-adjusted logistic regression and smoothed curve analysis were used to evaluate the correlation between the TyG index and endometriosis.\nResults: The results of MR analysis confirmed that higher TyG index was causally associated with the risk of endometriosis (OR=1.27, 95%CI: 1.05-1.54, P=0.01). In the cross-sectional study, subjects in the highest quartile of TyG index had the highest risk of incident endometriosis after adjusting for covariates(OR = 2.41, 95% CI:1.31-4.44, P for trend <0.01). The smoothed curve analysis also revealed a positive linear correlation between TyG index and endometriosis.\nConclusion: Our study confirms that a higher TyG index is associated with an increased risk of endometriosis by MR analysis and cross-sectional study. These findings suggested that TyG index could serve as a biomarker in identifying individuals who may be at a higher risk for developing endometriosis. Further research is needed to explore the potential clinical implications of these findings and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms behind this observed relationship."

Cognitive impairment is one of the most common long-term consequences of TBI, seriously affect the quality of life. We aimed to develop and validate a predictive model for cognitive impairment in TBI patients, with the goal of early identification and support for those at risk of developing cognitive impairment at the time of hospital admission.\nMethods: The training cohort included 234 TBI patients, all of whom were admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from May 2017 to April 2020. These patients were selected from our previously published studies. Baseline characteristics, medical history, clinical TBI characteristics, treatment details, and vital signs during hospitalization were screened via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to construct a predictive net risk score. The derived score represents an estimate of the risk of developing cognitive impairment in patients with TBI. A nomogram was constructed, and its accuracy and predictive performance were evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves, and clinical decision curves. For the validation cohort, data were prospectively collected from TBI patients admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from March 1, 2024 to August 30, 2024, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This study is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) at http://www.chictr.org.cn/ (registration number: ChiCTR2400083495).\nFindings: The training cohort included 234 patients. The mean (standard deviation, SD) age of the patients in the cohort was 47.74 (17.89) years, and 184 patients (78.63%) were men. The validation cohort included 84 patients with a mean (SD) age of 48.44 (14.42) years, and 68 patients (80.95%) were men. Among the 48 potential predictors, the following 6 variables were significant independent predictive factors and were included in the net risk score: age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.08, P = 0.00), years of education (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70-0.93, P = 0.00), pulmonary infection status (OR = 4.64, 95% CI: 1.41-15.27, P = 0.01), epilepsy status (OR = 4.79, 95% CI: 1.09-21.13, P = 0.04), cerebrospinal fluid leakage status (OR = 5.57, 95% CI: 1.08-28.75, P = 0.04), and the Helsinki score (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.28-1.83, P = 0.00). The AUC in the training cohort was 0.90, and the cut-off value was 0.71. The AUC in the validation cohort was 0.87, and the cut-off value was 0.63. The score was translated into an online risk calculator that is freely available to the public (https://yuanxiaofang.shinyapps.io/Predict_cognitive_impairment_in_TBI/).\nInterpretation: This model for predicting post-TBI cognitive impairment has potential value for facilitating early predictions by clinicians, aiding the early initiation of preventative interventions for cognitive impairment.\nFunding: This research was supported by Science and Technology Development Plan Project of ChangZhou (CJ20229036); Science and Technology Project of Changzhou Health Commission (QN202113)."

Our objectives were to assess whether the risk of respiratory and neurologic PASC differs by race/ethnicity and social drivers of health.\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of individuals <21 years seeking care at 24 health systems across the U.S, using electronic health record (EHR) data. Our cohort included those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular, serology or antigen test, or with a COVID-19, multisystem inflammatory disease in children, or PASC diagnosis from February 29, 2020 to August 1, 2022. We identified children/youth with at least 2 codes associated with respiratory and neurologic PASC. We measured associations between sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and respiratory and neurologic PASC using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals estimated from multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for other sociodemographic characteristics, social vulnerability index or area deprivation index, time period of cohort entry, presence and complexity of chronic respiratory (respectively, neurologic) condition and healthcare utilization.\nFindings: Among 771,725 children in the cohort, 203,365 (26.3%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among children with documented infection, 3217 children had respiratory PASC and 2009 children/youth had neurologic PASC. In logistic regression models, children <5 years (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.78, 95% CI 1.62-1.97), and of Hispanic White descent (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05-1.35) had higher odds of having respiratory PASC. Children/youth living in regions with higher area deprivation indices (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.10-1.420 for 60-79th percentile) and with chronic complex respiratory conditions (OR 3.28, 95% CI 2.91-3.70) also had higher odds of respiratory PASC.

There has been a rapidly expanding knowledge of the molecular and pathogenetic mechanisms of H. pylori over the decades. This review summarizes the latest research advances to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the H. pylori infection in gastric carcinogenesis. Our investigation of the molecular mechanisms reveals a complex network involving STAT3, NF-κB, Hippo, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, which are dysregulated in gastric cancer caused by H. pylori. Furthermore, we highlight the role of H. pylori in inducing oxidative stress, DNA damage, chronic inflammation, and cell apoptosis-key cellular events that pave the way for carcinogenesis. Emerging evidence also suggests the effect of H. pylori on the tumor microenvironment and its possible implications for cancer immunotherapy. This review synthesizes the current knowledge and identifies gaps that warrant further investigation. Despite the progress in our previous knowledge of the development in H. pylori-induced gastric cancer, a comprehensive investigation of H. pylori's role in gastric cancer is crucial for the advancement of prevention and treatment strategies. By elucidating these mechanisms, we aim to provide a more in-depth insights for the study and prevention of H. pylori-related gastric cancer."

This study aims to systematically analyze the global HF disease burden from 1990 to 2021 across temporal, spatial, and demographic dimensions to provide evidence for targeted prevention and control strategies.\nMethods: Using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, we analyzed the global HF burden through prevalent cases, years lived with disability (YLDs), and age-standardized rates per 100,000 population. Temporal trends were evaluated using estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) and joinpoint regression analysis. The relationship between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and disease burden was explored through Pearson correlation analysis, while attribution analysis identified the main causes of HF. When appropriate, analyses were stratified by 5 SDI regions, 21 GBD regions, 204 countries and territories, 20 age groups, and both sexes.\nResults: Global HF prevalence and YLDs burden showed substantial increases from 1990 to 2021, with age-standardized prevalence increasing from 641.14 to 676.68 per 100,000 population. Notably, high-SDI regions exhibited a declining burden since 2019, indicating a potential global turning point. High-income North America bears the heaviest burden while South Asia shows the fastest growth rate. The correlation between disease burden and SDI level was negligible. The disease burden in males consistently exceeded that in females, with prevalence and YLDs rates rising sharply after age 60. The main causes and their attributable proportions were: ischemic heart disease (34.53%), hypertensive heart disease (22.53%), other cardiomyopathies (7.61%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6.51%), and congenital heart anomalies (5.69%), with their distribution patterns differing across age groups and regions.\nConclusion: Global burden of HF increased significantly over recent decades, with a potential turning point in 2019 and marked regional disparities. It is essential to prioritize regions with heavy burdens or rapid growth rates, strengthen the management of major causes, and monitor HF burden trends in the post-COVID era."

We evaluated the feasibility, safety, immunogenicity, and clinical activity of adjuvant vaccination with Wilms' tumor protein (WT1) mRNA-electroporated autologous dendritic cells (WT1-mRNA/DC) in a single-arm phase I/II clinical study of patients with advanced solid tumors receiving standard therapy. Disease status and immune reactivity were evaluated after 8 weeks and 6 months. WT1-mRNA/DC vaccination was feasible in all patients, except one. Vaccination was well tolerated without evidence of systemic toxicity. The disease control rate and overall response rate among a total of 39 evaluable patients were 74.4% and 12.8%, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was 43.7 months among 13 patients with glioblastoma multiforme, 41.9 months among 12 patients with metastatic breast cancer, and 48.8 months among 10 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, comparing favourably with historical controls reported in the literature. OS was longer in patients with stable disease at 8 weeks and disease control at 6 months versus patients without disease control at either time point. Disease control and higher OS were associated with antigen-specific type 1 CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-lymphocyte responses, mainly induced by WT1-mRNA/DC vaccination. Antigen-nonspecific type 2 CD8+ T-cell responses were common before WT1-mRNA/DC vaccination but did not show any association with clinical outcome. Collectively, these data indicate that WT1-mRNA/DC vaccination is feasible, safe, and immunogenic and shows clinical activity in patients with advanced solid tumors, suggesting that it has the potential to help improve their survival."

However, no study has investigated the role of peripheral blood immune cells in ALS pathophysiology using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq).\nMethods: We aimed to characterize immune cells from blood and identify ALS-related immune alterations at single-cell resolution. For this purpose, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from 14 ALS patients and 14 cognitively unimpaired healthy individuals (HC), matched by age and gender, and cryopreserved until library preparation and scRNAseq.

Flow cytometry was used to validate alterations in cell type proportions.\nResults: We identified the expansion of CD56dim natural killer (NK) cells in ALS (fold change = 2; adj. p-value = 0.0051), mainly driven by a specific subpopulation, NK_2 cells (fold change = 3.12; adj. p-value = 0.0001), which represent a mature and cytotoxic CD56dim NK subset. Our results revealed extensive gene expression alterations in NK_2 cells, pointing towards the activation of immune response (adj. p-value = 9.2 × 10- 11) and the regulation of lymphocyte proliferation (adj. p-value = 6.46 × 10- 6). We also identified gene expression changes in other immune cells, such as classical monocytes, and distinct CD8 + effector memory T cells which suggested enhanced antigen presentation via major histocompatibility class-II (adj. p-value = 1.23 × 10- 8) in ALS. The inference of cell-cell communication patterns demonstrated that the interaction between HLA-E and CD94:NKG2C from different lymphocytes to NK_2 cells is unique to ALS blood compared to HC. Finally, regression analysis revealed that the proportion of CD56bright NK cells along with the ALSFRS-r, disease duration, and gender, explained up to 76.4% of the variance in plasma NfL levels.\nConclusion: Our results reveal a signature of relevant changes occurring in peripheral blood immune cells in ALS and underscore alterations in the proportion, gene expression, and signaling patterns of a cytotoxic and terminally differentiated CD56dim NK subpopulation (NK_2), as well as a possible role of CD56bright NK cells in neurodegeneration."

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases (LBDs), including Parkinson's disease (PD), involves α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregation that originates in peripheral organs and spreads to the brain. PD incidence is increased in individuals with chronic renal failure, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we observed α-Syn deposits in the kidneys of patients with LBDs and in the kidney and central nervous system of individuals with end-stage renal disease without documented LBDs. In male mice, we found that the kidney removes α-Syn from the blood, which is reduced in renal failure, causing α-Syn deposition in the kidney and subsequent spread into the brain. Intrarenal injection of α-Syn fibrils induces the propagation of α-Syn pathology from the kidney to the brain, which is blocked by renal denervation. Deletion of α-Syn in blood cells alleviates pathology in α-Syn A53T transgenic mice. Thus, the kidney may act as an initiation site for pathogenic α-Syn spread, and compromised renal function may contribute to the onset of LBDs."

    "abstract": "Background: Recent proteomic studies have documented that Long COVID in adults is characterized by a pro-inflammatory signature with thromboinflammation. However, if similar events happen also in children with Long COVID has never been investigated.\nMethods: We performed an extensive protein analysis of blood plasma from pediatric patients younger than 19 years of age Long COVID and a control group of children with acute COVID-19, MIS-C, and healthy controls resulted similar for sex distribution and age. Children were classified as Long COVID if symptoms persisted for at least 8 weeks since the initial infection, negatively impacted daily life and could not be explained otherwise.\nResults: 112 children were included in the study, including 34 children fulfilling clinical criteria of Long COVID, 32 acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, 27 MIS-C and 19 healthy controls. Compared with controls, pediatric Long COVID was characterized by higher expression of the proinflammatory and pro-angiogenetic set of chemokines CXCL11, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, TNFSF11, OSM, STAMBP1a. A Machine Learning model based on proteomic profile was able to identify LC with an accuracy of 0.93, specificity of 0.86 and sensitivity of 0.97.\nConclusions: Pediatric Long COVID patients have a well distinct blood protein signature marked by increased ongoing general and endothelial inflammation, similarly as happens in adults.\nImpact: Pediatric Long COVID has a distinct blood protein signature marked by increased ongoing general and endothelial inflammation. This is the first study studying and documenting proinflammatory profile in blood samples of children with long COVID. Long COVID was characterized by higher expression of the proinflammatory and pro-angiogenetic set of chemokines CXCL11, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, TNFSF11, OSM, STAMBP1a. A proteomic profile was able to identify Long COVID with an accuracy of 0.93, specificity of 0.86 and sensitivity of 0.97. These findings may inform development of future diagnostic tests."

However, to validate IFSH as a reliable imaging biomarker, further replication studies are required. The objective of this study was to investigate associations between IFSH and CSVD, and their potential repercussions, i.e., cognitive impairment and depression. We prospectively recruited 47 patients with CSVD and 29 cognitively normal controls (NC). IFSH were rated visually based on FLAIR MRI. Using different regression models, we explored the relationship between IFSH, group status (CSVD vs. NC), CSVD severity assessed with MRI, cognitive function, and symptoms of depression. Patients with CSVD were more likely to have higher IFSH scores compared to NC (OR 5.64, 95% CI 1.91-16.60), and greater CSVD severity on MRI predicted more severe IFSH (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.14-1.88). Higher IFSH scores were associated with lower cognitive function (-0.96, 95% CI -1.81 to -0.10), and higher levels of depression (0.33, 95% CI 0.01-0.65). CSVD and IFSH may be tightly linked to each other, and the accumulation of waste products, indicated by IFSH, could have detrimental effects on cognitive function and symptoms of depression."

The analysis focused on age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR), prevalence rates (ASPR), mortality rates (ASMR), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Joinpoint regression was used to determine the average annual percentage change (AAPC), and the ARIMA model was employed to forecast trends from 2022 to 2050. Results showed a significant increase in ASIR and ASPR in China, with a more rapid rise compared to global trends. ASMR and DALYs showed a decline, indicating improved survival rates. However, the increasing DALYs in China suggest a growing health impact. The ARIMA projections indicate a continued increase in EOCRC burden in China, highlighting the need for enhanced prevention and early detection strategies. This study underscores the necessity for intensified public health interventions to address the rising incidence of EOCRC in China."

    "abstract": "CD8+T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) are often functionally impaired, which limits their ability to mount effective anti-tumor responses. However, the molecular mechanisms behind this dysfunction remain incompletely understood. Here, we identified valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a key regulator of CD8+T cells suppression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our findings reveal that VCP suppresses the activation, expansion, and cytotoxic capacity of CD8+T cells both in vitro and in vivo, significantly contributing to the immunosuppressive nature of the TME. Mechanistically, VCP stabilizes the expression of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like protein (GPD1L), leading to the accumulation of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), a downstream metabolite of GPD1L. The accumulated G3P diffuses into the TME and directly interacts with SRC-family tyrosine kinase LCK, a critical component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway in CD8+T cells. This interaction heightens the phosphorylation of Tyr505, a key inhibitory residue, ultimately reducing LCK activity and impairing downstream TCR signaling. Consequently, CD8+T cells lose their functional capacity, diminishing their ability to fight against HCC. Importantly, we demonstrated that targeting VCP in combination with anti-PD1 therapy significantly suppresses HCC tumor growth and restores the anti-tumor function of CD8+T cells, suggesting synergistic therapeutic potential. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized mechanism involving VCP and G3P in suppressing T-cell-mediated immunity in the TME, positioning VCP as a promising upstream target for enhancing immunotherapy in HCC."

    "abstract": "Cushing syndrome (CS) is a constellation of signs and symptoms caused by excessive exposure to exogenous or endogenous glucocorticoid hormones. Endogenous CS is caused by increased cortisol production by one or both adrenal glands (adrenal CS) or by elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion from a pituitary tumour (Cushing disease (CD)) or non-pituitary tumour (ectopic ACTH secretion), which stimulates excessive cortisol production. CS is associated with severe multisystem morbidity, including impaired cardiovascular and metabolic function, infections and neuropsychiatric disorders, which notably reduce quality of life. Mortality is increased owing to pulmonary emboli, infection, myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents. The clinical presentation is variable and because some CS signs and symptoms are common in the general population, the diagnosis might not be considered until many features have accumulated. Guidelines recommend screening patients with suspected CS with 24-h urine cortisol, bedtime salivary cortisol and/or 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test. Subsequently, determining the aetiology of CS is important as it affects management. The first-line therapy for all aetiologies of endogenous CS is surgical resection of the causal tissue, including corticotroph adenoma or ectopic tumour for ACTH-dependent CS or unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy for adrenal CS. Second-line therapies include steroidogenesis inhibitors for any cause of CS, pituitary radiation (with or without steroidogenesis inhibitors) for CD, and bilateral adrenalectomy for ACTH-dependent causes of CS."

    "abstract": "The opioid crisis, driven by synthetic opioids like fentanyl, demands innovative solutions. The opioid antidote naloxone has a short action ( ~ 1 hour), requiring repeated doses. To address this, we present a new and simple naloxone prodrug delivery system repurposing a hydrophilic derivative of acoramidis, a potent transthyretin ligand. When the fully soluble prodrug solution is administered subcutaneously, the prodrug forms a zwitterionic depot at physiological pH, enabling extended naloxone release. This non-polymeric depot-forming approach is rare and employs carboxylesterase 2 for selective bioactivation, ensuring controlled drug release. In male rats and cynomolgus monkeys, a single subcutaneous dose provides steady naloxone release over several days, reducing blood-brain barrier diffusion, withdrawal symptoms, and CNS toxicity. Preclinical studies demonstrated efficacy in rat overdose models and achieved monkey naloxone levels matching effective human therapeutic levels. Although monkey efficacy was not assessed, combined rat efficacy and monkey pharmacokinetics suggest strong potential for successful human translation."

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) presents a significant therapeutic challenge, with few options for preserving joint cartilage and repairing associated tissue damage. Inflammation is a pivotal factor in OA-induced cartilage deterioration and synovial inflammation. Recently, exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HucMSCs) have gained recognition as a promising noncellular therapeutic modality, but their use is hindered by the challenge of harvesting a sufficient number of exosomes with effective therapeutic efficacy. Given that HucMSCs are highly sensitive to microenvironmental signals, we hypothesized that priming HucMSCs within a proinflammatory environment would increase the number of exosomes secreted with enhanced anti-inflammatory properties. Subsequent miRNA profiling and pathway analysis confirmed that interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β)-induced exosomes (C-Exos) exert positive effects through miRNA regulation and signaling pathway modulation. In vitro experiments revealed that C-Exos enhance chondrocyte functionality and cartilage matrix production, as well as macrophage polarization, thereby enhancing cartilage repair. C-Exos were encapsulated in hyaluronic acid hydrogel microspheres (HMs) to ensure sustained release, leading to substantial improvements in the inflammatory microenvironment and cartilage regeneration in a rat OA model. This study outlines a strategy to tailor exosome cargo for anti-inflammatory and cartilage regenerative purposes, with the functionalized HMs demonstrating potential for OA treatment."

    "abstract": "A substantial number of patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) undergo a nephrectomy, especially in work-up for a kidney transplantation. Currently, there is no evidence-based algorithm to guide clinicians which patients should undergo nephrectomy, the optimal timing of this procedure, or the preferred surgical technique. This systematic review-based consensus statement aimed to answer important questions regarding nephrectomy in ADPKD. A literature review was performed and extended to a meta-analysis when possible. For this purpose, PubMed and EMBASE were searched up to May 2024. Fifty-four publications, describing a total of 2391 procedures, were included. In addition, an exploratory questionnaire was sent to urologists, nephrologists, and transplant-surgeons. These sources were used to develop practice points about indications, complications, mortality, timing, and technique of nephrectomy. In addition, data on renal embolization as a potential alternative to nephrectomy was explored and summarized. To reach consensus, practice points were defined and improved in three Delphi survey rounds by experts of the European Renal Association Working Group Genes & Kidney and the European Association of Urology Section of Transplantation Urology. A total of 23 practice points/statements were developed, all of which reached consensus. Among others, it was deemed that nephrectomy can be performed successfully for various indications and is an intermediate risk procedure with acceptable mortality and minimal impact on kidney graft function when performed before, in the same session or after transplantation. The complication rate seems to increase when the procedure is performed as an emergency. During the work-up for transplantation, patient complaints should be assessed routinely by questionnaires to indicate symptom burden. Deciding on the need for nephrectomy and exploring potential alternatives such as kidney embolization should be a process of shared decision making, preferably after multidisciplinary consultation."

    "abstract": "Background and objective: Selection of patients harboring mutations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes for treatment with a PARP inhibitor (PARPi) is challenging in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). To gain further insight, we quantitatively assessed the differential efficacy of PARPi therapy among patients with mCRPC and different HRR gene mutations.\nMethods: This living meta-analysis (LMA) was conducted using the Living Interactive Evidence synthesis framework. We included clinical trials assessing PARPi as monotherapy in pretreated mCRPC or in combination with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) in treatment-naïve patients. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed for a priori subgroups stratified by HRR status, BRCA status, and each gene.\nKey findings and limitations: This first report for our LMA includes 13 trials (4278 patients). Among patients with pretreated mCRPC receiving PARPi monotherapy, the tumor response rate per 100 person-months was numerically higher for patients with BRCA2 (50% prostate-specific antigen response [PSA50%] 3.3; objective response rate [ORR] 3.3), BRCA1 (PSA50% 1.2; ORR 2.0), or PALB2 (PSA50% 3.3; ORR 1.4) alterations than for patients with ATM (PSA50% 0.4; ORR 0.3), CDK12 (PSA50% 0.2; ORR 0.2), or CHEK2 (PSA50% 1.0; ORR 0.7) alterations. Among patients receiving PARPi + ARPI, a significant radiographic progression-free survival benefit was observed in those with BRCA (hazard ratio [HR] 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13-0.62) or CDK12 (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.95) alterations, but not in patients with PALB2 (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.21-1.32), ATM (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.57-1.53), or CHEK2 (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.53-1.61) alterations. An overall survival benefit was observed for patients with BRCA alterations (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31-0.71) after adjustment for crossover and subsequent therapy, but not for patients with PALB2 (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.10-1.16), ATM (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.57-1.67), CDK12 (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.36-1.78), or CHEK2 (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.37-1.75) alterations.\nConclusions and clinical implications: Our LMA delivers information on the effect of PARPi therapy in relation to specific gene alterations in mCRPC via an interactive web platform. The evidence suggests the greatest PARPi benefit in patients with BRCA alterations, a strong signal of benefit in patients with PALB2 or CDK12 alterations, and no benefit in patients with ATM or CHEK2 alterations."

In the context of increased demand experienced by the services through the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as reduced funding, we aimed to evaluate such services to help assess their effectiveness and resilience.\nMethods: This multinational cross-sectional survey, conducted from Sept 1, 2022, to Feb 28, 2023, evaluated SHSs in 150 countries. Local collaborators created an SHS directory, and a 42-question questionnaire was distributed via Survey Monkey through Find A Helpline and local collaborators. A team of experts, including individuals with lived experience, helped shape the research questions and study design. We did descriptive statistical analysis of answers to the questions, and data were further analysed using the Bayesian Model Averaging method to predict managers' or supervisors' low overall satisfaction with the service (MS-LOSS).\nFindings: The study involved 446 responses from 105 countries for descriptive statistics. 354 (79·4%) of 446 services had insufficient funding, 249 (55·8%) had post-COVID-19 budget reductions, and 278 (62·3%) observed a sharp rise in suicide help requests during the COVID-19 pandemic. 420 responses were used for finding the optimal logistic model, which had an area under the curve of 0·679, indicating that pre-service training for volunteers was significantly associated with a reduction in MS-LOSS (odds ratio 0·16 [95% CI 0·07-0·31]; p<0·001), as was having a quality assurance structure (0·15 [0·02-0·70]; p=0·030). Higher MS-LOSS was associated with staff training only every 2-3 years instead of one or more times per year (2·87 [1·23-6·85], p=0.016) and with dilemmas with providing services in severe cases (1·68 [1·06-2·68]; p=0·028).\nInterpretation: Global SHS reports indicate that both pre-task and ongoing training for volunteers and staff, coupled with a quality assurance structure, could decrease MS-LOSS. Our findings emphasise the need for training for volunteers, continuous training programmes for staff, and on-site support for individuals at risk of suicide.\nFunding: RSTMH Small Grants Award 2021, UK NIHR, and MEXT."

    "abstract": "Background: Chordoma is a slow-growing, primary malignant bone tumor that arises from notochordal tissue in the midline of the axial skeleton. Surgical excision with negative margins is the mainstay of treatment, but high local recurrence rates are reported even with negative margins. High-dose radiation therapy (RT), such as with proton or carbon ions, has been used as an alternative to surgery, but late local failure remains a problem. B7-H3 is an immune checkpoint, transmembrane protein that is dysregulated in many cancers, including chordoma. This study explores the efficacy of B7-H3 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) therapy in vitro and in vivo.\nMethods: Chordoma cancer stem cells (CCSCs) were identified using flow cytometry, sphere formation, and western blot analysis. The expression of B7-H3 in paraffin-embedded chordoma tissue was determined by immunohistochemical staining, and the expression of B7-H3 in chordoma cells was measured by flow cytometry. Retroviral particles containing either B7-H3 or CD19 CAR-expressing virus were transduced into T cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from healthy human donor blood to prepare CAR-T cells. Animal bioluminescent imaging was used to evaluate the killing effect of CAR-T cells on chordoma cells in vivo. An irradiator was used for all irradiation (IR) experiments.\nResults: The combination of B7-H3 CAR-T cell therapy and IR has a greater killing effect on killing radiation-resistant CCSCs and bulk chordoma cells compared with CAR-T cell or IR monotherapy. Additionally, increased expression of B7-H3 antigens on CCSCs and bulk tumor cells is associated with enhanced CAR-T cell killing in vitro and in vivo xenograft mouse models. Upregulation of B7-H3 expression by IR increases CCSCs sensitivity to B7-H3 CAR-T cell-mediated killing.\nConclusions: Our preliminary data show that IR and B7-H3 CAR-T cell therapy is synergistically more effective than either IR or CAR-T cell monotherapy in killing chordoma cells in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. These results provide preclinical evidence for further developing this combinatorial RT and B7-H3 CAR-T cell therapy model in chordoma."

    "abstract": "Background: More efficient therapeutic options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are needed as the survival at 5 years of metastatic disease is near zero. In this regard, we used a preclinical model of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (SV2-OVA) to assess the safety and efficacy of novel radio-immunotherapy combining hypofractionated radiotherapy (HRT) with muPD1-IL2v immunocytokine and muFAP-CD40 bispecific antibody.\nMethods: We evaluated the changes in the lung immune microenvironment at multiple timepoints following combination therapies and investigated their underlying antitumor mechanisms. Additionally, we analyzed the tumor clonal heterogeneity upon the combination treatments to explore potential mechanisms associated with the lack of complete response.\nResults: The combination of HRT with muPD1-IL2v had a potent antitumor effect and increased survival in the SV2-OVA lung cancer model. Importantly, this combination therapy was devoid of measurable toxicity. It induced remodeling of the immune contexture through the increase of CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells. The addition of muFAP-CD40 to the combination treatment further increased infiltrating CD8+ T cells, expressing high levels of effector molecules, both in the periphery and core tumor regions. An accumulation of CD8+ PD-1+ TOX+ (exhausted) T cells, already at the 'early' timepoint, is consistent with the limited clinical benefits provided by the various combination treatments in this model. The study of the clonal dynamics of tumor cells during disease progression and therapy highlighted a clonal selection upon HRT+muPD1-IL2v therapy.\nConclusions: We demonstrated that HRT+muPD1-IL2v combination is a potent therapeutic strategy to delay tumor growth and increase survival in a metastatic lung cancer model, but additional studies are required to completely understand the resistance mechanisms associated with the lack of complete response in this model."

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children. MASLD encompasses a spectrum of liver disease and can be severe, with 10% of affected children presenting with advanced fibrosis. While biopsy remains the most accurate method for diagnosing and staging the disease, MRI proton density fat fraction and magnetic resonance elastography are the most reliable non-invasive measures for assessing steatosis and fibrosis, respectively. MASLD is associated with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, decreased bone mineral density, obstructive sleep apnoea, anxiety and depression. Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments available for children, highlighting the urgent need for paediatric clinical trials. A diet low in free sugars is promising for reducing steatosis and decreasing alanine aminotransferase, a surrogate marker for hepatic inflammation. Emerging data indicate that steatosis can be present in children under 6 years of age, which was previously considered rare. The intricate interplay of genetics may inform future therapeutics and prognostication, with the PNPLA3 gene showing the most evidence for association with the risk and severity of steatotic liver disease and steatohepatitis. MASLD is a complex disease affecting one in ten children and is associated with increased early mortality risk. More dedicated studies are needed in children to advance our understanding of this disease and find effective treatments."

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously termed nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease, is an important and rising health issue with a link with atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD), affecting ∼25-30% of the adults in the general population; in patients with diabetes, its prevalence culminates to ∼70%; its evolutive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, is estimated to be the main cause of liver transplantation in the future. MASLD is a multisystem disease that affects, besides the liver, extra-hepatic organs and regulatory pathways; it raises the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), CVD, and chronic kidney disease; the disease may also progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. Its diagnosis requires hepatic steatosis and at least one cardiometabolic risk factor and the exclusion of both significant alcohol consumption and other competing causes of chronic liver disease. Beyond CV events, associated metabolic comorbidities comprise obesity (∼50%), T2D (∼20%), hyperlipidemia (∼70%), hypertension (∼40%), and metabolic syndrome (∼40%). Among the various clinical events, CV events mostly determine prognosis as they are the leading cause of death in these patients. Regarding management, statins exert beneficial effects in improving liver injury; silybin, derived from Silybum marianum, has some protective effects; lifestyle modification, such as weight loss, dietary changes, physical exercise, and abstention from alcohol use combined with optimal management of comorbidities are most helpful. Bariatric surgery may be an option in persons with MASLD and obesity. Adults with non-cirrhotic MASLD and significant liver fibrosis may be candidates for targeted treatment with resmetirom, which has histological efficacy on steatohepatitis and fibrosis with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, whereas, no MASLD-targeted pharmacotherapy can be beneficial in the cirrhotic stage, whereby other measures may include metabolic drugs, nutritional counseling, surveillance for portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, and finally, liver transplantation in decompensated cirrhosis."

    "heading": "Drosophila Modulo is Essential for Transposon Silencing and Developmental Robustness",
    "abstract": "Transposable element (TE) silencing in the germline is crucial for preserving genome integrity; its absence results in sterility and diminished developmental robustness. The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway is the primary small non-coding RNA mechanism by which TEs are silenced in the germline. Three piRNA binding proteins promote the piRNA pathway function in the germline- P-element-induced wimpy testis (Piwi), Aubergine (Aub), and Argonaute 3 (Ago3). Piwi mediates transcriptional silencing of TEs by promoting the deposition of the heterochromatin mark Histone 3 lysine nine trimethylation (H3K9me3) at TE genomic sites. Aub and Ago3 facilitate post-transcriptional silencing of TEs. Proteins and mechanisms that promote piRNA function in TE silencing are still being discovered. This study demonstrates that the Drosophila Modulo protein, a homolog of mammalian Nucleolin and an epigenetic regulator, is crucial for the enrichment of H3K9me3 at TEs. We show that Modulo interacts with Piwi and operates downstream of the Piwi-piRNA complex's entry into the nucleus. Lack of Modulo function impairs Piwi-interacting protein Panoramix's ability to target transposon RNAs. Furthermore, the reduced function of Modulo in the mother undermines developmental robustness and exacerbates neomorphic Kr[If-1]-induced ectopic eye outgrowths in the offspring. Maternal Modulo enhances developmental robustness by inhibiting TE activation and transcriptome variability associated with intrinsic genetic variation. Thus, Modulo is an essential component of the mechanism that operates in the maternal germline to facilitate TE silencing and ensure developmental robustness in the ensuing generation."

    "heading": "A new Mediterranean Lifestyle Pyramid for children and youth: a critical lifestyle tool for preventing obesity and associated cardiometabolic diseases in a sustainable context",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular risk factors begin in childhood and track into adulthood, increasing the possibility of impaired cardiometabolic health. Adopting healthy dietary patterns can help curb childhood obesity, a worrisome epidemic problem at present. In the era of personalized nutrition, dietary recommendations should be adapted to different stages of life, including children (older than 3 years) and adolescents. Hereby, we present an updated version of the Mediterranean Lifestyle Pyramid addressed to children and adolescents, wihich may be used as a prevention tool by health professionals, teachers, and stakeholders. This pyramid arises from a consensus position between participants in a forum on Mediterranean Food Cultures with international experts. During this meeting, after reviewing all literature published, a consensus was reached on the new Medieterranean Lifestyle Pyramid for kids including details such as labels of the pyramid, position of foods, servings, type of foods, and healthy lifestyle habits. All components of the pyramid are supported by the most recent scientifically sound research and are based upon top-level evidence in nutritional sciences. Fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, wholegrains, and EVOO continue to be at the basis of the pyramid, but the importance of an adequate intake of fish, dairy products, and meat during these particular ages, when body and brain development occurs, is also considered. The promotion of physical activity, adequate sleep and good emotional health are emphasized, as well as the consumption of seasonal and local products, and overall sustainability. Improving dietary habits in early stages of life should increase health in adulthood and reduce future incidence of non-communicable chronic diseases. The Mediterranean Diet and its graphic representation in the Lifestyle Pyramid should be a health-fostering tool not only for adults and children, but also for the entire planet because it promotes the diversity of species, respect for the earth, and the local economy. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NUMBER AND WEBSITE WHERE IT WAS OBTAINED: Not applicable STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: A new Mediterranean lifestyle pyramid is addressed to children and adolescents, as well as health professionals, teachers, and stakeholders. Fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, wholegrain cereals, and extra-virgin olive oil continue to be a crucial part of the pyramid, but the importance of adequate intake of fish, dairy products, and meat in these early ages, when body and brain development occurs, is also emphasized."

    "abstract": "Background: Prospective data comparing watch-and-wait (WW) to mandatory total mesorectal excision (TME) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) remains limited, as randomized control trials assessing these two treatment approaches are considered impractical. This pooled analysis of the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 and OPRA trials analyzes survival outcomes among LARC patients managed with either a selective WW or mandatory TME strategy following total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT).\nPatients and methods: The CAO/ARO/AIO-12 and OPRA trials were multicenter, phase II trials that randomized patients with stage II/III rectal cancer to receive either induction or consolidation chemotherapy as part of TNT. All patients in the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial underwent TME within six weeks of completing TNT. The OPRA trial allowed patients with a complete or near-complete response to enter WW while those with an incomplete response proceeded to TME. The primary endpoint of the present pooled analysis was disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary endpoints included distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and overall survival (OS).\nResults: This pooled analysis included 628 patients (n=304 CAO/ARO/AIO-12; n=324 OPRA). Median follow-up was 3.6 (IQR 1.13) and 5.1 (IQR 2.2) years, respectively. Patients in the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial were more likely to have cT3/4 and cN positive disease while patients in the OPRA trial had tumors closer to the anal verge. Compliance to TNT and rates of grade 3+ adverse events were similar between studies. There were no differences in DFS, DRFS, LRFS or OS based on treatment strategy or TNT treatment arm.\nConclusions: This pooled analysis demonstrated equivalent oncologic outcomes between patients treated with mandatory TME and selective WW strategies following TNT. These results strengthen available evidence indicating that WW is a safe treatment option for patients with an excellent response to neoadjuvant therapy."

    "heading": "Thermal ablation versus surgical resection of small-size colorectal liver metastases (COLLISION): an international, randomised, controlled, phase 3 non-inferiority trial",
    "abstract": "Background: For patients with small-size colorectal liver metastases, growing evidence suggests thermal ablation to be associated with fewer adverse events and faster recovery than resection while also challenging resection in terms of local control and overall survival. This study assessed the potential non-inferiority of thermal ablation compared with surgical resection in patients with small-size resectable colorectal liver metastases.\nMethods: Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) from 14 centres in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Italy with ten or fewer small-size (≤3 cm) colorectal liver metastases, no extrahepatic metastases, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, were stratified per centre, and according to their disease burden, into low, intermediate, and high disease burden subgroups and randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either thermal ablation (experimental group) or surgical resection (control group) of all target colorectal liver metastases using the web-based module Castor electronic data capture with variable block sizes of 4, 6, and 8. Although at the operator's discretion, a minimally invasive approach in both treatment groups was recommended. The primary endpoint was overall survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. A hazard ratio (HR) of 1·30 was considered the upper limit of non-inferiority for the primary endpoint. A preplanned interim analysis with predefined stopping rules for futility (conditional power to prove the null hypothesis <20%) and early benefit (conditional power >90%, superior safety outcomes for the experimental group, and no difference or superiority regarding local control for the experimental group) was done 12 months after enrolment of 50% of the planned sample size. Safety was assessed per treatment group. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03088150.\nFindings: Between Aug 7, 2017, and Feb 14, 2024, 300 patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n=148, 100 male [68%] and 48 female [32%]; median age 67·9 years [IQR 29·2-85·7]) or to the control group (n=148, 107 male [72%] and 41 female [28%]; median age 65·1 [IQR 31·4-87·4]); four patients (two in each treatment group) were excluded after randomisation because they were found to have other disease pathology. Median follow-up at the prespecified interim analysis was 28·9 months (IQR 0·3-77·8). The trial was stopped early for meeting the predefined stopping rules: (1) a conditional likelihood to prove non-inferiority for overall survival of 90·5% (median overall survival not reached in both groups; HR 1·05; 95% CI 0·69-1·58; p=0·83), (2) a non-inferior local control (median local control not reached in both groups; HR 0·13, 95% CI 0·02-1·06; p=0·057), and (3) a superior safety profile for the experimental group. Patients in the experimental group had fewer adverse events than those in the control group (28 [19%] vs 67 [46%]; p<0·0001). Serious adverse events occurred in 11 (7%) of 148 patients in the experimental group and 29 (20%) of 146 in the control group, mostly periprocedural haemorrhage requiring intervention (one [1%] vs eight [5%]), and infectious complications requiring intervention (six [4%] vs 11 [8%]). There were no treatment-related deaths in the experimental group and three treatment-related deaths (2%) in the control group (two due to postoperative cardiac complications and one due to sepsis and liver failure).\nInterpretation: The assumption that thermal ablation should be reserved for unresectable colorectal liver metastases requires re-evaluation and the preferred treatment should be individualised and based on clinical characteristics and available expertise.\nFunding: Medtronic-Covidien."

    "abstract": "Background: About half of patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) have type 2 diabetes. In the STEP-HFpEF DM trial of adults with obesity-related HFpEF and type 2 diabetes, subcutaneous once weekly semaglutide 2·4 mg conferred improvements in heart failure-related symptoms and physical limitations, bodyweight, and other heart failure outcomes. We aimed to determine whether these effects of semaglutide differ according to baseline HbA1c.\nMethods: STEP-HFpEF DM, a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 108 clinical research sites across 16 countries in Asia, Europe, and North and South America, included individuals aged 18 years or older with documented HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥45%), type 2 diabetes, and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), with a block size of four within each stratum using an interactive web response system, stratified by baseline BMI (<35 kg/m2vs ≥35 kg/m2), to receive either semaglutide 2·4 mg or placebo subcutaneously. The effects of semaglutide versus placebo on the efficacy endpoints were evaluated by HbA1c categories at baseline: low (<6·5%; <48 mmol/mol), medium (6·5% to <7·5%; 48 mmol/mol to <58 mmol/mol), and high (≥7·5%; ≥58 mmol/mol). The dual primary endpoints were change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS) and bodyweight percentage from baseline to 52 weeks and were assessed in all randomly assigned participants by intention to treat. Hypoglycaemia events were also analysed to assess safety in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04916470.\nFindings: Between June 27, 2021 and Sept 2, 2022, 616 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned (mean age 68·4 years [SD 8·9]; 273 [44%] were female, 343 [56%] were male, and 519 [84%] were White). The low baseline HbA1c group included 227 participants (112 assigned to semaglutide and 115 to placebo), the medium baseline HbA1c group included 226 participants (124 assigned to semaglutide and 102 to placebo), and the high baseline HbA1c group included 163 participants (74 assigned to semaglutide and 89 to placebo). The median duration of follow-up in the overall trial was 401 days (IQR 400-405). The change in KCCQ-CSS from baseline to 52 weeks was 12·4 points (95% CI 8·8 to 16·0) with semaglutide versus 5·7 points (2·1 to 9·2) with placebo (mean difference 6·7 points [1·6 to 11·8]) in the low baseline HbA1c group, 14·5 points (11·0 to 17·9) versus 8·5 points (4·8 to 12·2; 6·0 points [0·9 to 11·1]) in the medium baseline HbA1c group, and 14·5 points (10·0 to 19·0) versus 4·8 points (0·7 to 8·9; 9·6 points [3·5 to 15·7]) in the high baseline HbA1c group (pinteraction=0·64; ptrend=0·46). The change in bodyweight percentage from baseline to 52 weeks was -10·8 (95% CI -12·1 to -9·5) with semaglutide versus -3·3% (-4·6 to -2·0) with placebo (mean difference -7·5% [-9·4 to -5·6]) in the low baseline HbA1c group, -9·6% (-10·8 to -8·3) versus -3·3% (-4·7 to -1·9; -6·3 [-8·2 to -4·4]) in the medium baseline HbA1c group, and -8·6% (-10·2 to -7·0) versus -3·6% (-5·2 to -2·1; -5·0 [-7·2 to -2·7]) in the high baseline HbA1c group (pinteraction=0·22; ptrend=0·083). Hypoglycaemia events occurred in 30 (10%) of 310 participants (70 events; 22·9 events per 100 person-years) in the semaglutide group compared with 21 (7%) of 306 participants in the placebo group (90 events; 29·5 events per 100 person-years).\nInterpretation: Semaglutide 2·4 mg improved heart failure-related symptoms and physical limitations, and reduced bodyweight in patients with obesity-related HFpEF and type 2 diabetes, all independently of baseline HbA1c, and resulted in lower rates of hypoglycaemia than placebo, despite a well controlled baseline HbA1c and broad use of concomitant glucose-lowering medications.\nFunding: Novo Nordisk."

While other fields have used large sequencing compendia to extract insights requiring otherwise impractical sample sizes, the microbiome field has lacked a comparably sized resource for the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing commonly used to quantify microbiome composition. To address this gap, we processed 168,464 publicly available human gut microbiome samples with a uniform pipeline. We use this compendium to evaluate geographic and technical effects on microbiome variation. We find that regions such as Central and Southern Asia differ significantly from the more thoroughly characterized microbiomes of Europe and Northern America and that composition alone can be used to predict a sample's region of origin. We also find strong associations between microbiome variation and technical factors such as primers and DNA extraction. We anticipate this growing work, the Human Microbiome Compendium, will enable advanced applied and methodological research."

However, mechanisms underlying pleiotropic effects of the associated variants remain to be explored. We conducted a massively parallel reporter assay to decode the regulatory logic of variants with pleiotropic and disorder-specific effects. Pleiotropic variants differ from disorder-specific variants by exhibiting chromatin accessibility that extends across diverse cell types in the neuronal lineage and by altering motifs for transcription factors with higher connectivity in protein-protein interaction networks. We mapped pleiotropic and disorder-specific variants to putative target genes using functional genomics approaches and CRISPR perturbation. In vivo CRISPR perturbation of a pleiotropic and a disorder-specific gene suggests that pleiotropy may involve the regulation of genes expressed broadly across neuronal cell types and with higher network connectivity."

    "abstract": "The ongoing circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1) viruses, particularly clade 2.3.4.4b strains, poses a significant threat to animal and public health. Recent outbreaks in cattle highlight concerns about cross-species transmission and zoonotic spillover. Here, we found that the hemagglutinin (HA) protein from a cattle-infecting H5N1 virus has acquired slight binding to human-like α2-6-linked receptors while still exhibiting a strong preference for avian-like α2-3-linked sialic acid receptors. Immunohistochemical staining revealed HA binding to bovine pulmonary and mammary tissues, aligning with clinical observations. HA also binds effectively to human conjunctival, tracheal, and mammary tissues, indicating a risk for human transmission, notably in cases of conjunctivitis. High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of this H5 HA in complex with either α2-3 or α2-6 receptors elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its receptor-binding properties. These findings provide critical insights into the tropism and transmission potential of this emerging pathogen."

Host genetic factors are associated with NTM-PD susceptibility. However, the heritability of NTM-PD is not well understood. Here, we perform a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) and discover a susceptibility locus at 16p21 associated with NTM-PD, especially with pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease. As the lead variant, rs194800 C allele augments protein kinase C beta (PRKCB) gene expression and associates with severer NTM-PD. The functional studies show that PRKCB exacerbates M. avium infection and promotes intracellular survival of M. avium in macrophages by inhibiting phagosomal acidification. Mechanistically, PRKCB interacts with subunit G of the vacuolar-H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) and vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 16 homolog (VPS16), blocking the fusion between lysosomes and mycobacterial phagosomes. PRKCB inhibitor has therapeutic potential against M. avium infection. These findings provide insights into the genetic etiology of NTM-PD and highlight PRKCB as an attractive target for host-directed therapy of MAC disease."

This oxysterol signature overlapped with a plasma metabolite signature associated with human PAH mortality. Mice deficient for endothelial Ncoa7 or exposed to an inflammatory bile acid developed worsened PAH. Genetic predisposition to NCOA7 deficiency was driven by single-nucleotide polymorphism rs11154337, which alters endothelial immunoactivation and is associated with human PAH mortality.

In Eif2s3y, Uty, and Zfy2 deletants, spermatogenesis was impaired. We found that Uty regulates spermatogonial proliferation, revealed a role for Zfy2 in promoting meiotic sex chromosome pairing, and uncovered unexpected effects of Y genes on the somatic testis transcriptome. In the remaining single Y-gene deletants, spermatogenesis appeared unperturbed, but testis transcription was still altered. Multigene deletions, including a human-infertility AZFa model, exhibited phenotypes absent in single Y deletants. Thus, Y genes may regulate spermatogenesis even if they show no phenotypes when deleted individually. This study advances our knowledge of Y evolution and infertility and provides a resource to dissect Y-gene functions in other tissues."

This method enables high-throughput, spatially resolved profiling of thousands of operons within individual bacteria. Using bacterial-MERFISH, we dissected the response of Escherichia coli to carbon starvation, systematically mapped subcellular RNA organization, and charted the adaptation of a gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to micrometer-scale niches in the mammalian colon.

Mice self-stimulate the SVTg, which can also be activated directly by the neocortex, resulting in effective inhibition of the lateral habenula, a region associated with depression.

    "abstract": "Background: Self-reported health problems following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are common and often include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The long-term prognosis of such post-acute sequelae of COVID-19/post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is unknown, and data finding and correlating organ dysfunction and pathology with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS is scarce. We wanted to describe clinical characteristics and diagnostic findings among patients with PCS persisting for >1 year and assessed risk factors for PCS persistence versus improvement.\nMethods and findings: This nested population-based case-control study included subjects with PCS aged 18-65 years with (n = 982) and age- and sex-matched control subjects without PCS (n = 576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (6-12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo comprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median, range 3-14 months] after phase 1). The mean age of the participants was 48 years, and 65% were female. At phase 2, 67.6% of the patients with PCS at phase 1 developed persistent PCS, whereas 78.5% of the recovered participants remained free of health problems related to PCS. Improvement among patients with earlier PCS was associated with mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. The development of new symptoms related to PCS among participants initially recovered was associated with an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. Patients with persistent PCS were less frequently never smokers (61.2% versus 75.7%), more often obese (30.2% versus 12.4%) with higher mean values for body mass index (BMI) and body fat, and had lower educational status (university entrance qualification 38.7% versus 61.5%) than participants with continued recovery. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters. Exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise (PEM) for >14 h and symptoms compatible with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of participants with persistent PCS patients, respectively. In analyses adjusted for sex-age class combinations, study centre and university entrance qualification, significant differences between participants with persistent PCS versus those with continued recovery were observed for performance in three different neurocognitive tests, scores for perceived stress, subjective cognitive disturbances, dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue and quality of life. In persistent PCS, handgrip strength (40.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) [39.4, 41.1]] versus 42.5 [95% CI [41.5, 43.6]] kg), maximal oxygen consumption (27.9 [95% CI [27.3, 28.4]] versus 31.0 [95% CI [30.3, 31.6]] ml/min/kg body weight) and ventilatory efficiency (minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope, 28.8 [95% CI [28.3, 29.2]] versus 27.1 [95% CI [26.6, 27.7]]) were significantly reduced relative to the control group of participants with continued recovery after adjustment for sex-age class combinations, study centre, education, BMI, smoking status and use of beta blocking agents. There were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function at rest, in the level of N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, markers of Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, serum levels of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate). Screening for viral persistence (PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma) in a subgroup of the patients with persistent PCS was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings. Patients with persistent PCS and PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests. A limitation was that we had no objective information on exercise capacity and cognition before acute infection. In addition, we did not include patients unable to attend the outpatient clinic for whatever reason including severe illness, immobility or social deprivation or exclusion.\nConclusions: In this study, we observed that the majority of working age patients with PCS did not recover in the second year of their illness. Patterns of reported symptoms remained essentially similar, non-specific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. Despite objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity, there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations, and our findings do not support viral persistence, EBV reactivation, adrenal insufficiency or increased complement turnover as pathophysiologically relevant for persistent PCS. A history of PEM was associated with more severe symptoms and more objective signs of disease and might help stratify cases for disease severity."

The highest CVD burden is seen in low-middle SDI levels. Regional disparities, differences in health system outcomes, and SDI-related inequalities persist. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke are significant contributors among CVD subtypes. The burden is more pronounced in older age groups and men. Notably, 79.5% of total CVD disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were attributable to 11 risk factors, with high Body Mass Index (BMI) showing the most significant increase.\nConclusion: Despite advancements, CVD remains a significant global burden, especially in low and lower-middle SDI regions. Rising prevalence and the impact of COVID-19 underscore ongoing challenges. The diverse burden across health systems highlights the need for sustained investment in healthcare infrastructure and targeted interventions. Addressing modifiable risk factors and socio-economic inequalities is essential."

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aims to explore the role of exosome-related genes in breast cancer (BRCA) metastasis by integrating RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from BRCA samples and to develop a reliable prognostic model.\nMethods: Initially, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on exosome-related genes from the BRCA cohort in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Three prognostic genes (JUP, CAPZA1 and ARVCF) were identified through univariate Cox regression and Lasso-Cox regression analyses, and a metastasis-related risk score model was established based on these genes. Immune cell infiltration, immune escape and drug sensitivity disparities between high- and low-risk groups were assessed using CIBERSORT and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) methods. High- and low-risk cell populations were discerned based on the expression of prognostic genes in BRCA scRNA-seq data.\nResults: M0 and M1 macrophages significantly promote the metastasis of breast cancer (BRCA). The developed prognostic model demonstrates good predictive performance for patient survival at 1, 3 and 5 years, with AUC values of 0.654, 0.602 and 0.635, respectively. Compared to the low-risk group, the high-risk group exhibits increased immune cell infiltration and higher levels of immune evasion. scRNA-seq data reveal that high-risk cells have significantly higher risk scores and exhibit notable differences in signalling pathways and intercellular communication patterns.\nConclusions: This study presents a novel risk score model based on exosome-related genes, validated by comprehensive analyses including differential expression, survival analysis and external dataset validation. The model's clinical significance is reinforced through its ability to stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct survival outcomes and immune landscape characteristics. The integration of RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data highlights the predictive accuracy of the model and underscores its potential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and improving patient prognosis."

Patients who died within 3 months after surgery were excluded (landmark). Data were analyzed from February 1 to December 31, 2023.\nExposures: Preoperative (m)FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy followed by resection and eventually followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.\nMain outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was OS, calculated from the 3-month landmark. Cox regression analysis, including interaction analyses, was performed to investigate the association of adjuvant chemotherapy with OS.\nResults: Overall, 767 patients were included after resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (median [IQR] age, 62 [55-67] years; 404 [52.7%] male). Adjuvant chemotherapy was independently associated with prolonged OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.87), confirmed by adjusted OS curves. The interaction analysis to assess estimated treatment effect across subgroups was not statistically significant. The forest plot and interaction test suggest that the association of adjuvant chemotherapy was lower among patients receiving 8 or more cycles of preoperative (m)FOLFIRINOX, those who had radiological response, and those with ypN0 disease. Compared to no adjuvant chemotherapy, both adjuvant (m)FOLFIRINOX (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40-0.80) and other multiagent adjuvant regimens (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.92) were associated with prolonged OS, whereas single-agent adjuvant chemotherapy was not (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.55-1.03).\nConclusions and relevance: In this cohort study, adjuvant (m)FOLFIRINOX and other multiagent chemotherapy regimens were associated with improved OS following resection of localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma after preoperative (m)FOLFIRINOX, whereas single-agent adjuvant chemotherapy was not. The impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on OS may be lower in subgroups such as patients with 8 or more preoperative cycles of (m)FOLFIRINOX, those having radiological response, and those with ypN0."

    "abstract": "Importance: Previous studies have demonstrated the advantages of short-term histopathological outcomes and complications associated with transanal total mesorectal excision (TME) compared with laparoscopic TME. However, the long-term oncological outcomes of transanal TME remain ambiguous. This study aims to compare 3-year disease-free survival of transanal TME with laparoscopic TME.\nObjective: To evaluate 3-year disease-free survival between transanal TME and laparoscopic TME in patients with rectal cancer.\nDesign, setting, and participants: This randomized, open-label, noninferiority, phase 3 clinical trial was performed in 16 different centers in China. Between April 2016 and June 2021, a total of 1115 patients with clinical stage I to III mid-low rectal cancer were enrolled. The last date of participant follow-up was in June 2024.\nInterventions: Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio before their surgical procedure to undergo either transanal TME (n = 558) or laparoscopic TME (n = 557).\nMain outcomes and measures: The primary end point was 3-year disease-free survival, with a noninferiority margin of -10% for the comparison between transanal TME and laparoscopic TME. Secondary outcomes included 3-year overall survival and 3-year local recurrence.\nResults: In the primary analysis set, the median patient age was 60 years. A total of 692 male and 397 female patients were included in the analysis. Three-year disease-free survival was 82.1% (97.5% CI, 78.4%-85.8%) for the transanal TME group and 79.4% (97.5% CI, 75.6%-83.4%) for the laparoscopic TME group, with a difference of 2.7% (97.5% CI, -3.0% to 8.1%). The lower tail of a 2-tailed 97.5% CI for the group difference in 3-year disease-free survival was above the noninferiority margin of -10 percentage points. Furthermore, the 3-year local recurrence was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.0%-5.1%) for transanal TME and 4.4% (95% CI, 2.6%-6.1%) for laparoscopic TME. Three-year overall survival was 92.6% (95% CI, 90.4%-94.8%) for transanal TME and 90.7% (95% CI, 88.3%-93.2%) for laparoscopic TME.\nConclusions and relevance: In patients with mid-low rectal cancer, 3-year disease-free survival for transanal TME was noninferior to that of laparoscopic TME.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02966483."

    "abstract": "Importance: Understanding the interplay between diabetes risk factors and diabetes development is important to develop individual, practice, and population-level prevention strategies.\nObjective: To evaluate the progression from normal and impaired fasting glucose levels to diabetes among adults.\nDesign, setting, and participants: This retrospective community-based cohort study used data from the Rochester Epidemiology Project, in Olmsted County, Minnesota, on 44 992 individuals with at least 2 fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurements from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2017. People who met criteria for diabetes on or before their first FPG measurement were excluded. Data were electronically retrieved in December 2019 with analyses finalized in November 2024.\nExposures: The exposure was baseline FPG level, with covariates including the following measures that are consistently recorded in the electronic health record: body mass index (BMI), age, and sex.\nMain outcomes and measures: The cumulative probability of freedom from diabetes was estimated and presented graphically using a Kaplan-Meier curve. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to estimate the partial hazard ratios (HRs) for variables of interest. Diabetes was defined as an FPG level greater than 125 mg/dL.\nResults: A total of 44 992 individuals (mean [SD] age at baseline, 43.7 [11.8] years; 26 025 women [57.8%]) were included. The baseline mean (SD) BMI was 28.9 (6.6). Over a median follow-up of 6.8 years (IQR, 3.6-9.7 years), 3879 individuals (8.6%) developed diabetes. The Kaplan-Meier 10-year cumulative risk of incident diabetes was 12.8% (95% CI, 12.4%-13.2%). All initial FPG levels outside a range of 80 to 94 mg/dL were associated with increased risk for diabetes (ie, FPG <70 mg/dL: HR, 3.49 [95% CI, 2.19-5.57]; FPG 120-125 mg/dL: HR, 12.47 [10.84-14.34]). Other independent risk factors were male sex (HR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.22-1.40]), older age (≥60 years: HR, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.71-2.28]), and any abnormal category of BMI, including underweight (BMI <18.5: HR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.77-3.29]; BMI ≥40: HR, 4.03 [95% CI, 3.56-4.56]). There was a significant additive association of variables, particularly FPG level and BMI. For instance, a woman aged 55 to 59 years with a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 and an FPG level of 95 to 99 mg/dL had an estimated 10-year diabetes risk of 7.0%. However, an almost doubling of risk to 13.0% was observed if the BMI was 30.0 to 34.9, and risk more than doubled again to 28.0% if FPG level also increased to 105 to 109 mg/dL. A nomogram was generated to facilitate individual classification into one of four 10-year risk categories.\nConclusions and relevance: This retrospective cohort study of 44 992 individuals suggests that FPG level, age, BMI, and male sex were all associated with development of diabetes, with significant interaction between these variables. These data contribute to understanding the clinical course of diabetes and highlight the substantial individual variation in diabetes risk according to commonly measured clinical variables. The findings facilitate lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions to treat those at highest risk of diabetes to reduce future morbidity and mortality. Further work is needed to validate this risk categorization tool for different populations."

    "abstract": "Importance: The increasing use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) demands a better understanding of their association with thyroid cancer.\nObjective: To estimate the risk of incident thyroid cancer among adults with type 2 diabetes being treated with GLP-1RA vs other common glucose-lowering medications.\nDesign, setting, and participants: This was a prespecified secondary analysis of a target trial emulation of a comparative effectiveness study using claims data for enrollees in commercial, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare fee-for-service plans across the US. Eligible participants were adults with type 2 diabetes at moderate risk for cardiovascular disease and without history of thyroid cancer who had newly filled prescriptions for GLP-1RA, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i), or sulfonylurea from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2021. Data were analyzed February 1 to October 31, 2024.\nMain outcomes and measures: Overall and piecewise (<1, 1-2, and ≥2 years since treatment initiation) hazard ratios (HRs) for thyroid cancer with use of GLP-1RA vs the other 3 drug classes were estimated using inverse propensity score weighted Cox proportional hazards models. Modified intention-to-treat (mITT) (primary) and as-treated (sensitivity) analyses were performed.\nResults: Of 351 913 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.3 [8.5] years; 173 391 [49.3%] females and 178 522 [50.7%] males), 41 112 started treatment with GLP-1RA; 76 093, with DPP4i; 43 499, with SGLT2i; and 191 209, with sulfonylurea therapy. The numbers of patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer were 69 (0.17%) in the GLP-1RA group, 172 (0.23%) in the DPP4i group, 72 (0.17%) in the SGLT2i group, and 381 (0.20%) in the sulfonylurea group. In the mITT analysis, GLP-1RA initiation was not significantly associated with increased overall risk for thyroid cancer compared to the other 3 diabetes drugs (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.88-1.76). However, the risk for thyroid cancer was significantly higher within the first year after GLP-1RA initiation (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.11-3.08) and was amplified in the overall as-treated analysis that censored patients when therapy was discontinued or another medication was added (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.10-3.95).\nConclusions and relevance: This secondary analysis of a target trial emulation of a comparative effectiveness study found that despite the low absolute risk of thyroid cancer among patients receiving GLP-1RA therapy, there was an increased risk of new thyroid cancer diagnoses within the first year of GLP-1RA initiation compared to 3 other diabetes drugs. This finding may have been due to enhanced early detection; therefore, further research is necessary to understand the underlying causes of this association."

    "abstract": "To regulate brain function, peripheral compounds must traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB), an interface between the brain and the circulatory system. To determine whether specific transport mechanisms are relevant for sleep, we conducted a BBB-specific inducible RNAi knockdown (iKD) screen for genes affecting sleep in Drosophila. We observed reduced sleep with knockdown of solute carrier CG6126, a carnitine transporter, as determined by isotope flux. Our findings suggest that CG6126 regulation of sleep is through the role of the carnitine shuttle in regulating fatty acid metabolism as lipid droplets accumulate in the brains of CG6126 BBB iKD flies. Knocking down mitochondrial carnitine transferases in non-BBB glial cells mimicked the reduced sleep of the CG6126 BBB iKD flies, while bypassing the necessity of carnitine transport with dietary medium-chain fatty acids or palmitoylcarnitine rescued sleep. We propose that carnitine transport via CG6126 promotes brain fatty acid metabolism necessary for maintaining sleep."

    "abstract": "Ankyrin Repeat Domain-containing Protein 11 (ANKRD11) is a causative gene for KBG syndrome, a significant risk factor for Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), and a highly confident autism spectrum disorder gene. Mutations of ANKRD11 lead to developmental abnormalities in multiple organs/tissues including the brain, craniofacial and skeletal bones, and tooth structures with unknown mechanism(s). Here, we find that ANKRD11, via a short peptide fragment in its N-terminal region, binds to the cohesin complex with a high affinity, implicating why ANKRD11 mutation can cause CdLS. The crystal structure of the ANKRD11 peptide in complex with cohesin, together with biochemical experiments, revealed that ANKRD11 competes with CCCTC-binding factor in binding to the cohesin complex. Importantly, a single point mutation in ANKRD11 (Tyr347 to Ala) specifically disrupted the interaction between ANKRD11 and cohesin and perturbed gene expressions in a mouse embryonic stem cell model. Mice carrying the ANKRD11 Y347A mutation display neural and craniofacial anomalies, which mirror clinical phenotypes observed in KBG syndrome patients. Thus, our study reveals how ANKRD11 functions together with cohesin to regulate gene expression and also provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning developmental disorders caused by ANKRD11 mutations."

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous roles of complement C3 have been implicated in tumor metastasis and are highly context dependent. However, the underlying mechanisms linking C3 to tumor metastasis remain elusive in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here, we demonstrate that C3 of RCC cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) contributes to metastasis via polarizing tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) into the immunosuppressive phenotype and recruiting polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs). Mechanistically, EV C3 induces the secretion of CCL2 and CXCL1 by lung macrophages and subsequently enhances TAM polarization and PMN-MDSC recruitment. Notably, targeting the CCL2/CCR2 or CXCL1/CXCR2 axis with the inhibitors RS504393 or Navarixin, respectively, effectively suppresses lung metastasis induced by RCC-derived C3 in a mouse model. Clinically, RCC patients with high expression of C3 demonstrate poor prognosis. Collectively, our findings reveal that tumor-derived EV C3 induces an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment via TAMs, and thus promoting RCC metastasis."

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes persistent infection, causes infectious mononucleosis, is a major trigger for multiple sclerosis and contributes to multiple cancers. Yet, knowledge remains incomplete about how the virus remodels host B cells to support lytic replication. We previously identified that EBV lytic replication results in selective depletion of plasma membrane (PM) B cell receptor (BCR) complexes, composed of immunoglobulin and the CD79A and CD79B signaling chains. Here, we used proteomic and biochemical approaches to identify that the EBV early lytic protein BALF0/1 is responsible for EBV lytic cycle BCR degradation. Mechanistically, an immunoglobulin heavy chain (HC) cytoplasmic tail KVK motif was required for ubiquitin-mediated BCR degradation, while CD79A and CD79B were dispensable. BALF0/1 subverted caveolin-mediated endocytosis to internalize PM BCR complexes and to deliver them to the endoplasmic reticulum. BALF0/1 stimulated immunoglobulin HC cytoplasmic tail ubiquitination, which together with the ATPase valosin-containing protein/p97 drove ER-associated degradation of BCR complexes by cytoplasmic proteasomes. BALF0/1 knockout reduced the viral load of secreted EBV particles from B cells that expressed a monoclonal antibody against EBV glycoprotein 350 but not a control anti-influenza hemagglutinin antibody and increased viral particle immunoglobulin incorporation. Consistent with downmodulation of PM BCR, BALF0/1 overexpression reduced viability of a diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell line whose survival is dependent upon BCR signaling. Collectively, our results suggest that EBV BALF0/1 downmodulates immunoglobulin upon lytic reactivation to block BCR signaling and support virion release, but await the development of suitable models to test its roles in EBV reactivation in vivo."

    "abstract": "Background: Invasive systems are commonly used for monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and are considered the gold standard. The availability of invasive ICP monitoring is heterogeneous, and in low- and middle-income settings, these systems are not routinely employed due to high cost or limited accessibility. The aim of this consensus was to develop recommendations to guide monitoring and ICP-driven therapies in TBI using non-invasive ICP (nICP) systems.\nMethods: A panel of 41 experts, that regularly use nICP systems for guiding TBI care, was established. Three scoping and four systematic reviews with meta-analysis were performed summarizing the current global-literature evidence. A modified Delphi method was applied for the development of recommendations. An in-person meeting with group discussions and voting was conducted. Strong recommendations were defined for an agreement of at least 85%. Weak recommendations were defined for an agreement of 75-85%.\nResults: A total of 34 recommendations were provided (32 Strong, 2 Weak) divided into three domains: general consideration for nICP use, management of ICP using nICP methods and thresholds of nICP tools for escalating/de-escalating treatment. We developed four clinical algorithms for escalating treatment and heatmaps for de-escalating treatment.\nConclusions: Using a mixed-method approach involving literature review and an in-person consensus by experts, a set of recommendations designed to assist clinicians managing TBI patients using nICP systems plus clinical assessment, in the presence or absence of brain imaging, were built. Further clinical studies are required to validate the potential use of these recommendations in the daily clinical practice."

Baseline NLR is independently associated with incident cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. However, whether this applies to acute myocarditis (AM) has not been evaluated.\nObjectives: The present study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of NLR in patients with AM.\nMethods: A total of 1,150 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of AM admitted to 10 international tertiary referral cardiac centers were included in the study. The diagnosis was confirmed using cardiac magnetic resonance or endomyocardial biopsy. The primary outcome measure was a composite of all-cause mortality or heart transplantation. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to an NLR cutoff of 4 derived from spline regression analysis and 70:30 train-test split algorithm.\nResults: Patients with an NLR <4 were younger and more likely to present with chest pain, and those with an NLR ≥4 were more likely to present with breathlessness and have other comorbidities. Over a median follow-up of 228 weeks, a NLR ≥4 was associated with a worse prognosis (P < 0.0001). After adjustment for prognostic variables, NLR emerged as an independent predictor of outcome (HR: 3.03 [95% CI: 1.30-7.04]; P = 0.010). Elevated NLR remained associated with worse outcomes among patients with preserved ejection fraction at baseline, who are conventionally considered to be at lower risk of adverse events (P < 0.0001).\nConclusions: In patients with AM, elevated NLR is associated with worse prognosis and may be valuable for stratifying patients, even those conventionally considered at low risk."

The pathways underlying this relationship, and specifically the role of circulating proteins, are unclear.\nMethods: Utilizing two-sample univariable Mendelian randomization (UVMR), multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR), and colocalization, based on summary data from large sex-combined and sex-specific genetic studies, we estimated the univariable associations between: (i) body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) and overall and site-specific (colon, proximal colon, distal colon, and rectal) CRC risk, (ii) BMI and WHR and circulating proteins, and (iii) adiposity-associated circulating proteins and CRC risk. We used MVMR to investigate the potential mediating role of adiposity- and CRC-related circulating proteins in the adiposity-CRC association.\nResults: BMI and WHR were positively associated with CRC risk, with similar associations by anatomical tumor site. In total, 6591 adiposity-protein (2628 unique circulating proteins) and 33 protein-CRC (7 unique circulating proteins) associations were identified using UVMR and colocalization. One circulating protein, GREM1, was associated with BMI (only) and CRC outcomes in a manner that was consistent with a potential mediating role in sex-combined and female-specific analyses. In MVMR, adjusting the BMI-CRC association for GREM1, effect estimates were attenuated-suggestive of a potential mediating role-most strongly for the BMI-overall CRC association in women.\nConclusion: Results highlight the impact of adiposity on the plasma proteome and of adiposity-associated circulating proteins on the risk of CRC. Supported by evidence from UVMR and colocalization analyses using cis-single-nucleotide polymorphisms, GREM1 was identified as a potential mediator of the BMI-CRC association, particularly in women."

    "abstract": "The skin, the largest organ of the human body, plays numerous essential roles, including protection against environmental hazards and the regulation of body temperature. The processes of skin homeostasis and ageing are complex and influenced by many factors, with epigenetic mechanisms being particularly significant. Epigenetics refers to the regulation of gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. The dynamic nature of the skin, characterized by constant cellular turnover and responsiveness to environmental stimuli, requires precise gene activity control. This control is largely mediated by epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and regulation by non-coding RNAs. The present review endeavours to provide a comprehensive exploration and elucidation of the role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating skin homeostasis and ageing. By integrating our current knowledge of epigenetic modifications with the latest advancements in dermatological research, we can gain a deeper comprehension of the complex regulatory networks that govern skin biology. Understanding these mechanisms also presents promising avenues for therapeutic interventions aimed at improving skin health and mitigating age-related skin conditions."

    "abstract": "Background: The decrease in S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) leads to an elevation of S-nitrosylation, thereby exacerbating the progression of cardiomyopathy in response to hemodynamic stress. However, the mechanisms under GSNOR decrease remain unclear. Here, we identify NEDD4 (neuronal precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated 4) as a novel molecule that plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, by modulating GSNOR levels, thereby demonstrating significant therapeutic potential.\nMethods: Protein synthesis and degradation inhibitors were used to verify the reasons for the decrease in GSNOR. Mass spectrometry and database filtering were used to uncover NEDD4, the E3 Ub (ubiquitin) ligase, involved in GSNOR decrease. NEDD4 cardiomyocyte-specific deficiency mice were used to evaluate the role of NEDD4 and NEDD4-induced ubiquitination of GSNOR in cardiac hypertrophy in vivo. Both IBM, a highly specific NEDD4 inhibitor, and indole-3-carbinol, a NEDD4 inhibitor currently undergoing phase 2 clinical trial, were used to effectively suppress the NEDD4/GSNOR axis.\nResults: GSNOR protein levels were reduced, while mRNA levels remained unchanged in myocardium samples from hypertrophic patients and transverse aortic constriction-induced mice, indicating GSNOR is regulated by ubiquitination. NEDD4, an E3 Ub ligase, was associated with GSNOR ubiquitination, which exhibited significantly higher expression levels in hypertrophic myocardial samples. Moreover, either the NEDD4 enzyme-dead mutant or GSNOR nonubiquitylated mutant decreased GSNOR ubiquitination and inhibited cardiac hypertrophic growth. Cardiomyocyte-specific NEDD4 deficiency inhibited cardiac hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo. NEDD4 inhibitor IBM effectively suppressed GSNOR ubiquitination and cardiac hypertrophy. Clinically, indole-3-carbinol, a NEDD4 inhibitor in phase II clinical trials used as an antitumor drug, demonstrated comparable efficacy.\nConclusions: Our findings showed that upregulated NEDD4 leads to GSNOR ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, thereby facilitating the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. NEDD4 inhibitors may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure."

Adults with ADHD on average experience poorer educational and employment outcomes, worse physical and mental health and are more likely to die prematurely. No studies have yet used mortality data to examine the life expectancy deficit experienced by adults with diagnosed ADHD in the UK or worldwide.\nAims: This study used the life-table method to calculate the life-expectancy deficit for people with diagnosed ADHD using data from UK primary care.\nMethod: A matched cohort study using prospectively collected primary care data (792 general practices, 9 561 450 people contributing eligible person-time from 2000-2019). We identified 30 039 people aged 18+ with diagnosed ADHD, plus a comparison group of 300 390 participants matched (1:10) by age, sex and primary care practice. We used Poisson regression to estimate age-specific mortality rates, and life tables to estimate life expectancy for people aged 18+ with diagnosed ADHD.\nResults: Around 0.32% of adults in the cohort had an ADHD diagnosis, ~1 in 9 of all adults with ADHD. Diagnoses of common physical and mental health conditions were more common in adults with diagnosed ADHD than the comparison group. The apparent reduction in life expectancy for adults with diagnosed ADHD relative to the general population was 6.78 years (95% CI: 4.50 to 9.11) for males, and 8.64 years (95% CI: 6.55 to 10.91) for females.\nConclusions: Adults with diagnosed ADHD are living shorter lives than they should. We believe that this is likely caused by modifiable risk factors and unmet support and treatment needs in terms of both ADHD and co-occurring mental and physical health conditions. This study included data from adults with diagnosed ADHD; the results may not generalise to the entire population of adults with ADHD, the vast majority of whom are undiagnosed."

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid nanostructures offer unique opportunities for biomedical applications due to their sequence-programmable structures and functions, which enable the design of complex responses to molecular cues. Control of the biological activity of therapeutic cargoes based on endogenous molecular signatures holds the potential to overcome major hurdles in translational research: cell specificity and off-target effects. Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) can be used to profile cell type and cell state, and are ideal inputs for RNA nanodevices. Here, we present CRISPR MiRAGE (miRNA-activated genome editing), a tool comprising a dynamic single-guide RNA that senses miRNA complexed with Argonaute proteins and controls downstream CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) activity based on the detected miRNA signature. We study the operation of the miRNA-sensing single-guide RNA and attain muscle-specific activation of gene editing through CRISPR MiRAGE in models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. By enabling RNA-controlled gene editing activity, this technology creates opportunities to advance tissue-specific CRISPR treatments for human diseases."

    "abstract": "Background: Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents, characterized by high disability and mortality rates. Over the past three decades, therapeutic outcomes have plateaued, underscoring the critical need for innovative therapeutic targets. Solute carrier (SLC) family transporters have been implicated in the malignant progression of a variety of tumors, however, their specific role in osteosarcoma remains poorly understood.\nMethods: The single-cell sequencing data from GSE152048 and GSE162454, along with RNA-seq from the TARGET and GSE21257 cohorts, were utilized for the analysis in this study. LASSO regression analysis was conducted to identify prognostic genes and construct an SLC-related prognostic signature. Survival analysis and ROC analysis evaluated the validity of the prognostic signature. The ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT Packages were utilized to assess the immune infiltration status. Pseudotime and CellChat analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between SLC7A1, malignant phenotypes, and the immune microenvironment. CCK8 assays, EdU staining, colony formation assays, Transwell assays, and co-culture systems were used to assess the effects of SLC7A1 on cell proliferation, metastasis, and macrophage polarization. Finally, virtual docking identified potential drugs targeting SLC7A1.\nResults: SLCs displayed distinct expression patterns across various cell types within the osteosarcoma microenvironment, with myeloid cells exhibiting a preference for amino acid uptake. A prognostic model comprising nine genes was constructed via LASSO regression, with SLC7A1 showing the highest hazard ratio. Multiple analytical algorithms indicated that SLCs were associated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression. Single-cell analysis indicated that SLC7A1 was predominantly expressed in osteosarcoma cells and correlated with various malignant tumor characteristics. SLC7A1 also regulate interactions between tumor cells and macrophages, as well as modulate macrophage function through multiple pathways. In vitro assays and survival analysis demonstrated that inhibition of SLC7A1 suppressed the malignant phenotype of osteosarcoma cells, with SLC7A1 expression correlating with poor prognosis. Co-culture models confirmed the involvement of SLC7A1 in macrophage polarization. Finally, virtual screening and CETSA identified Cepharanthine as potential inhibitors of SLC7A1.\nConclusion: SLC-related prognostic signatures can be utilized for the prognostic evaluation of osteosarcoma. Pharmacological inhibition of SLC7A1 may be a feasible therapeutic approach for osteosarcoma."

    "abstract": "Background: Insulin resistance (IR) is linked to an increased risk of frailty, yet it remains unclear whether the non-insulin-based IR indicators are associated with frailty trajectories and physical function decline. It aimed to examine the associations of triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR), estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) and with long-term deficit-accumulation frailty trajectories and physical function decline.\nMethods: Data from 6722 participants in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) were analyzed. Baseline TyG index, METS-IR, eGDR, along with the frailty index (FI) over nine years, were calculated. FI trajectories were assessed using group-based trajectory model (GBTM). Logistic regression models were used to analyze the associations between IR indicators with FI trajectory and frailty risk. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) models were utilized to detect potential dose-response associations. Linear mixed-effects model was used to evaluate associations with FI development speed. Age, gender, educational level, marital status, smoking status, drinking status, life satisfaction, social activity and sleep duration were adjusted. Additionally, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to assess the causality of observed associations.\nResults: Three FI trajectories including low-stable frailty, moderate-increasing frailty, and accelerated rising frailty were identified. Regarding the frail risk, each SD increment in TyG index was associated with a 16.1% increase in the risk of frailty (OR = 1.161; 95%CI: 1.092, 1.235). An inverse association was observed for eGDR with the OR (95%CI) being 0.741 (0.696, 0.788). A linear relationship was observed between baseline TyG index and frailty risk (P nonlinear = 0.696), but nonlinear association patterns for eGDR (P nonlinearity < 0.010) and METS-IR (P nonlinearity < 0.010). Each SD increment of TyG index was associated with greater FI increase (β = 0.005 SD/y; 95%CI = 0.002, 0.008 SD/y; P < 0.001). A similar association pattern was observed for METS-IR, and participants in the highest quartile of METS-IR showed significantly greater FI progression, with β value of 0.013 (95% CI = 0.004, 0.022). Each SD increment of eGDR was associated with a slower increase in FI (β=-0.006 SD/y, 95% CI=-0.009, -0.003 SD/y; P < 0.001). Participants in the highest quartile of eGDR presented a lower annual change in FI compared with participants in quartile 1 group during follow-up (β=-0.013 SD/y, 95% CI=-0.022, -0.005 SD/y; P for trend = 0.001). Similar findings were observed for physical function decline. Findings from MR analysis showed a causal relationship between higher TyG index and increased risk of frailty (β = 0.214, 95% CI = 0.079, 0.349; P = 0.002).\nConclusions: The non-insulin-based IR indicators, including TyG index, METS-IR and eGDR, were independently associated with the frailty progression and physical function decline. Monitoring and managing abnormal glucose metabolism should be recommended as a part of comprehensive strategies to prevent or delay the progression of frailty."

    "abstract": "Background: To elucidate the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying psoriasis by employing an integrative multi-omics approach, using summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) to infer causal relationships among DNA methylation, gene expression, and protein levels in relation to psoriasis risk.\nMethods: We conducted SMR analyses integrating genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics with methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data. Publicly available datasets were utilized, including psoriasis GWAS data from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute and the UK Biobank. Heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) test and colocalization analyses were performed to identify shared causal variants, and multi-omics integration was employed to construct potential regulatory pathways.\nResults: Our analyses identified significant causal associations between DNA methylation, gene expression, protein abundance, and psoriasis risk. We discovered two pathways involving the long non-coding RNA RP11-977G19.11 and apolipoprotein F (APOF). Methylation at sites cg26804944 and cg02705573 was negatively associated with RP11-977G19.11 expression. Reduced expression of RP11-977G19.11 was linked to increased APOF levels, which were positively associated with a higher risk of psoriasis. Methylation at sites cg00172967, cg00294382, and cg24773560 was positively associated with RP11-977G19.11 expression. Elevated expression of RP11-977G19.11 was associated with decreased APOF levels, reducing the risk of psoriasis. Colocalization analysis highlighted APOF as a key protein in psoriasis pathogenesis. Validation using skin tissue, EBV-transformed lymphocytes data and inflammation-related protein panels confirmed the associations of RP11-977G19.11 and APOF with psoriasis.\nConclusions: Our multi-omics analysis provides preliminary evidence for potential molecular mechanisms in psoriasis pathogenesis. Through the integration of GWAS and molecular QTL data, we identify candidate pathways that may be relevant to disease biology. While these findings require extensive experimental validation, they offer a framework for future investigations into the molecular basis of psoriasis."

    "abstract": "Background: Insulin resistance (IR) is a central pathophysiological factor in metabolic syndrome (MetS) and an essential driver of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. The estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) is a reliable marker of IR and has been associated with CVD prognosis. This study aims to examine the relationship between eGDR, MetS, and their predictive roles in clinical outcomes.\nMethods: Data from the NHANES (2001-2018) were utilized, with a cross-sectional design applied to evaluate the association between eGDR and MetS prevalence, and a cohort design employed for mortality follow-up. Weighted logistic regression models were used to examine the association between eGDR and MetS. Weighted Cox proportional hazard models were applied to assess the link between eGDR and both all-cause and CVD mortality. To examine the non-linear associations between the eGDR, MetS, and mortality outcomes, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was applied. Additionally, the predictive performance of eGDR, and other IR indices (TyG, HOMA-IR), for mortality was assessed using the C-statistic.\nResults: A robust negative association between eGDR and MetS prevalence was found, following full covariate adjustment (p < 0.001). The core findings were consistent across subgroups (all p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis indicated that in individuals with MetS, each standard deviation (SD) increment in eGDR was associated with an 11% and 18% decrement in the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively. RCS analysis displayed a non-linear association between eGDR and MetS prevalence, while a linear association between eGDR and mortality. The C-statistic showed that eGDR, compared to the TyG index and HOMA-IR, significantly improved predictive power for all-cause mortality (p = 0.007).\nConclusion: eGDR is strongly associated with MetS and predicts all-cause and CVD mortality in individuals with MetS. Compared to TyG and HOMA-IR, eGDR offers superior predictive value for all-cause mortality, highlighting its potential as a useful tool in clinical risk assessment."

Here we investigated the efficacy and safety of cadonilimab (PD-1/cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) bispecific antibody) plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in G/GEJ adenocarcinoma. The prespecified interim analysis is reported here. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study. Eligible patients were adults with untreated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic G/GEJ adenocarcinoma. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive cadonilimab (10 mg kg-1 every 3 weeks) or placebo plus chemotherapy (every 3 weeks). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) in the intention-to-treat population (one-sided significance level, P = 0.025). Secondary endpoints included OS in patients with a PD-L1 combined positive score ≥5, progression-free survival, objective response rate, duration of response and safety. As of 18 August 2023, 610 patients from 75 study centers were randomized to cadonilimab (n = 305) or placebo (n = 305). With a median follow-up of 18.7 months, the cadonilimab group had a significantly longer median OS (14.1 versus 11.1 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.81; P < 0.001) than the placebo group. The primary endpoint was met. The median progression-free survival was 7.0 months versus 5.3 months (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.44-0.65). The median OS in patients with a PD-L1 combined positive score ≥5 was 15.3 months versus 10.9 months (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41-0.82). The objective response rate was 65.2% versus 48.9% with a median duration of response of 8.8 months versus 4.4 months. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 65.9% of the cadonilimab group and 53.6% of the placebo group, and the most common were decreased platelet count, decreased neutrophil count and anemia. Most of the immune-related adverse events were grade 1 or 2. No new safety signals were observed. Cadonilimab plus chemotherapy significantly improved OS with a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05008783 ."

    "abstract": "Thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm poses a substantial mortality risk in adults, yet many of its underlying factors remain unidentified. Here, we identify mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)⁺ deficiency as a causal factor for the development of aortic aneurysm. Multiomics analysis of 150 surgical aortic specimens indicated impaired NAD+ salvage and mitochondrial transport in human thoracic aortic aneurysm, with expression of the NAD+ transporter SLC25A51 inversely correlating with disease severity and postoperative progression. Genome-wide gene-based association analysis further linked low SLC25A51 expression to risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection. In mouse models, smooth muscle-specific knockout of Nampt, Nmnat1, Nmnat3, Slc25a51, Nadk2 and Aldh18a1, genes involved in NAD+ salvage and transport, induced aortic aneurysm, with Slc25a51 deletion producing the most severe effects. Using these models, we suggest a mechanism that may explain the disease pathogenesis: the production of type III procollagen during aortic medial matrix turnover imposes a high demand for proline, an essential amino acid component of collagen. Deficiency in the mitochondrial NAD⁺ pool, regulated by NAD⁺ salvage and transport, hinders proline biosynthesis in mitochondria, contributing to thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm."

We analysed data from participants of European, East Asian, African American and Latino ancestries (n = 158,036 cases with bipolar disorder, 2.8 million controls), combining clinical, community and self-reported samples. We identified 298 genome-wide significant loci in the multi-ancestry meta-analysis, a fourfold increase over previous findings3, and identified an ancestry-specific association in the East Asian cohort. Integrating results from fine-mapping and other variant-to-gene mapping approaches identified 36 credible genes in the aetiology of bipolar disorder. Genes prioritized through fine-mapping were enriched for ultra-rare damaging missense and protein-truncating variations in cases with bipolar disorder4, highlighting convergence of common and rare variant signals. We report differences in the genetic architecture of bipolar disorder depending on the source of patient ascertainment and on bipolar disorder subtype (type I or type II). Several analyses implicate specific cell types in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, including GABAergic interneurons and medium spiny neurons. Together, these analyses provide additional insights into the genetic architecture and biological underpinnings of bipolar disorder."

In the small intestine, TRM cells are found in at least two distinct subpopulations: one with higher expression of effector molecules and another with greater memory potential1. However, the origins of this diversity remain unknown. Here we proposed that distinct tissue niches drive the phenotypic heterogeneity of TRM cells. To test this, we leveraged spatial transcriptomics of human samples, a mouse model of acute systemic viral infection and a newly established strategy for pooled optically encoded gene perturbations to profile the locations, interactions and transcriptomes of pathogen-specific TRM cell differentiation at single-transcript resolution. We developed computational approaches to capture cellular locations along three anatomical axes of the small intestine and to visualize the spatiotemporal distribution of cell types and gene expression. Our study reveals that the regionalized signalling of the intestinal architecture supports two distinct TRM cell states: differentiated TRM cells and progenitor-like TRM cells, located in the upper villus and lower villus, respectively. This diversity is mediated by distinct ligand-receptor activities, cytokine gradients and specialized cellular contacts. Blocking TGFβ or CXCL9 and CXCL10 sensing by antigen-specific CD8 T cells revealed a model consistent with anatomically delineated, early fate specification. Ultimately, our framework for the study of tissue immune networks reveals that T cell location and functional state are fundamentally intertwined."

However, experimental limitations hinder the comprehensive measurement of cells under native temporal dynamics and in their native spatial tissue niche. Optimal transport has emerged as a powerful tool to address these constraints and has facilitated the recovery of the original cellular context1-4. Yet, most optimal transport applications are unable to incorporate multimodal information or scale to single-cell atlases. Here we introduce multi-omics single-cell optimal transport (moscot), a scalable framework for optimal transport in single-cell genomics that supports multimodality across all applications. We demonstrate the capability of moscot to efficiently reconstruct developmental trajectories of 1.7 million cells from mouse embryos across 20 time points. To illustrate the capability of moscot in space, we enrich spatial transcriptomic datasets by mapping multimodal information from single-cell profiles in a mouse liver sample and align multiple coronal sections of the mouse brain. We present moscot.spatiotemporal, an approach that leverages gene-expression data across both spatial and temporal dimensions to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of mouse embryogenesis. We also resolve endocrine-lineage relationships of delta and epsilon cells in a previously unpublished mouse, time-resolved pancreas development dataset using paired measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our findings are confirmed through experimental validation of NEUROD2 as a regulator of epsilon progenitor cells in a model of human induced pluripotent stem cell islet cell differentiation.

Here we optimized adenine and cytosine deaminases to reduce off-target effects on the transcriptome and the mitochondrial genome, improving the accuracy and efficiency of our newly developed mitochondrial base editors (mitoBEs)1. Using these upgraded mitoBEs (version 2 (v2)), we targeted 70 mouse mitochondrial DNA mutations analogous to human pathogenic variants2, establishing a foundation for mitochondrial disease mouse models. Circular RNA-encoded mitoBEs v2 achieved up to 82% editing efficiency in mice without detectable off-target effects in the nuclear genome. The edited mitochondrial DNA persisted across various tissues and was maternally inherited, resulting in F1 generation mice with mutation loads as high as 100% and some mice exhibiting editing only at the target site. By optimizing the transcription activator-like effector (TALE) binding site, we developed a single-base-editing mouse model for the mt-Nd5 A12784G mutation. Phenotypic evaluations led to the creation of mouse models for the mt-Atp6 T8591C and mt-Nd5 A12784G mutations, exhibiting phenotypes corresponding to the reduced heart rate seen in Leigh syndrome and the vision loss characteristic of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, respectively. Moreover, the mt-Atp6 T8591C mutation proved to be more deleterious than mt-Nd5 A12784G, affecting embryonic development and rapidly diminishing through successive generations. These upgraded mitoBEs offer a highly efficient and precise strategy for constructing mitochondrial disease models, laying a foundation for further research in this field."

These receptors comprise a complex array of 19 related subunits, which form pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. The composition and structure of native GABAA receptors in the human brain have been inferred from subunit localization in tissue1,3, functional measurements and structural analysis from recombinant expression4-7 and in mice8. However, the arrangements of subunits that co-assemble physiologically in native human GABAA receptors remain unknown. Here we isolated α1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors from human patients with epilepsy. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we defined a set of 12 native subunit assemblies and their 3D structures. We address inconsistencies between previous native and recombinant approaches, and reveal details of previously undefined subunit interfaces. Drug-like densities in a subset of these interfaces led us to uncover unexpected activity on the GABAA receptor of antiepileptic drugs and resulted in localization of one of these drugs to the benzodiazepine-binding site. Proteomics and further structural analysis suggest interactions with the auxiliary subunits neuroligin 2 and GARLH4, which localize and modulate GABAA receptors at inhibitory synapses.

Existing maps1-5 are based solely on cross-over (CO) recombination, omitting non-cross-overs (NCOs)-the more common form of recombination6-owing to the difficulty in detecting them. Using whole-genome sequence data in families, we estimate the number of NCOs transmitted from parent to offspring and derive complete, sex-specific recombination maps including both NCOs and COs. Mothers have fewer but longer NCOs than fathers, and oocytes accumulate NCOs in a non-regulated fashion with maternal age. Recombination, primarily NCO, is responsible for 1.8% (95% confidence interval: 1.3-2.3) and 11.3% (95% confidence interval: 9.0-13.6) of paternal and maternal de novo mutations, respectively, and may drive the increase in de novo mutations with maternal age. NCOs are substantially more prominent than COs in centromeres, possibly to avoid large-scale genomic changes that may cause aneuploidy. Our results demonstrate that NCOs highlight to a much greater extent than COs the differences in the meiotic process between the sexes, in which maternal NCOs may reflect the safeguarding of oocytes from infancy until ovulation."

We describe protocols for delivery of ASOs to patient-derived organoid models and confirm reversal of disease-associated phenotypes in cardiac organoids derived from a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with a structural deletion in the gene encoding dystrophin (DMD) that is amenable to treatment with existing ASO therapeutics. Furthermore, we designed novel patient-specific ASOs for two additional patients with DMD (siblings) with a deep intronic variant in the DMD gene that gives rise to a novel splice acceptor site, incorporation of a cryptic exon and premature transcript termination. We showed that treatment of patient-derived cardiac organoids with patient-specific ASOs results in restoration of DMD expression and reversal of disease-associated phenotypes. The approach outlined here provides the foundation for an expedited path towards the design and preclinical evaluation of personalized ASO therapeutics for a broad range of rare diseases."

This renders either the maternal X (Xm) chromosome or the paternal X (Xp) chromosome inactive, causing X mosaicism that varies between female individuals, with some showing considerable or complete skew of the X chromosome that remains active5-7. Parent-of-X origin can modify epigenetics through DNA methylation8,9 and possibly gene expression; thus, mosaicism could buffer dysregulated processes in ageing and disease. However, whether X skew or its mosaicism alters functions in female individuals is largely unknown. Here we tested whether skew towards an active Xm chromosome influences the brain and body-and then delineated unique features of Xm neurons and Xp neurons. An active Xm chromosome impaired cognition in female mice throughout the lifespan and led to worsened cognition with age. Cognitive deficits were accompanied by Xm-mediated acceleration of biological or epigenetic ageing of the hippocampus, a key centre for learning and memory, in female mice. Several genes were imprinted on the Xm chromosome of hippocampal neurons, suggesting silenced cognitive loci. CRISPR-mediated activation of Xm-imprinted genes improved cognition in ageing female mice. Thus, the Xm chromosome impaired cognition, accelerated brain ageing and silenced genes that contribute to cognition in ageing. Understanding how Xm impairs brain function could lead to an improved understanding of heterogeneity in cognitive health in female individuals and to X-chromosome-derived pathways that protect against cognitive deficits and brain ageing."

Applying seq2PRINT to single-cell chromatin accessibility data from human bone marrow, we observe sequential establishment and widening of CREs centred on pioneer factors across haematopoiesis. We further discover age-associated alterations in the structure of CREs in murine haematopoietic stem cells, including widespread reduction of nucleosome footprints and gain of de novo identified Ets composite motifs. Collectively, we establish a method for obtaining rich insights into DNA-binding protein dynamics from chromatin accessibility data, and reveal the architecture of regulatory elements across differentiation and ageing."

    "abstract": "Tolerance to dietary antigens is critical for avoiding deleterious type 2 immune responses resulting in food allergy (FA) and anaphylaxis1,2. However, the mechanisms resulting in both the maintenance and failure of tolerance to food antigens are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the goblet-cell-derived resistin-like molecule β (RELMβ)3,4 is a critical regulator of oral tolerance. RELMβ is abundant in the sera of both patients with FA and mouse models of FA. Deletion of RELMβ protects mice from FA and the development of food-antigen-specific IgE and anaphylaxis. RELMβ disrupts food tolerance through the modulation of the gut microbiome and depletion of indole-metabolite-producing Lactobacilli and Alistipes. Tolerance is maintained by the local production of indole derivatives driving FA protective RORγt+ regulatory T (Treg) cells5 through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. RELMβ antagonism in the peri-weaning period restores oral tolerance and protects genetically prone offspring from developing FA later in life. Together, we show that RELMβ mediates a gut immune-epithelial circuit regulating tolerance to food antigens-a novel mode of innate control of adaptive immunity through microbiome editing-and identify targetable candidates in this circuit for prevention and treatment of FA."

    "heading": "Immune evasion through mitochondrial transfer in the tumour microenvironment",
    "abstract": "Cancer cells in the tumour microenvironment use various mechanisms to evade the immune system, particularly T cell attack1. For example, metabolic reprogramming in the tumour microenvironment and mitochondrial dysfunction in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) impair antitumour immune responses2-4. However, detailed mechanisms of such processes remain unclear. Here we analyse clinical specimens and identify mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in TILs that are shared with cancer cells. Moreover, mitochondria with mtDNA mutations from cancer cells are able to transfer to TILs. Typically, mitochondria in TILs readily undergo mitophagy through reactive oxygen species. However, mitochondria transferred from cancer cells do not undergo mitophagy, which we find is due to mitophagy-inhibitory molecules. These molecules attach to mitochondria and together are transferred to TILs, which results in homoplasmic replacement. T cells that acquire mtDNA mutations from cancer cells exhibit metabolic abnormalities and senescence, with defects in effector functions and memory formation. This in turn leads to impaired antitumour immunity both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, the presence of an mtDNA mutation in tumour tissue is a poor prognostic factor for immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with melanoma or non-small-cell lung cancer. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of cancer immune evasion through mitochondrial transfer and can contribute to the development of future cancer immunotherapies."

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease, one of more than 50 inherited repeat expansion disorders1, is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG expansion in HTT2. Inherited CAG repeat length is the primary determinant of age of onset, with human genetic studies underscoring that the disease is driven by the CAG length-dependent propensity of the repeat to further expand in the brain3-9. Routes to slowing somatic CAG expansion, therefore, hold promise for disease-modifying therapies. Several DNA repair genes, notably in the mismatch repair pathway, modify somatic expansion in Huntington's disease mouse models10. To identify novel modifiers of somatic expansion, we used CRISPR-Cas9 editing in Huntington's disease knock-in mice to enable in vivo screening of expansion-modifier candidates at scale. This included testing of Huntington's disease onset modifier genes emerging from human genome-wide association studies as well as interactions between modifier genes, providing insight into pathways underlying CAG expansion and potential therapeutic targets."

Certainty in findings were assessed using the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) approach.\nMain outcome measures: To compare treatments and to compare individual components informed by partnership with patients, clinicians, researchers, and health system leaders using an integrated knowledge translation framework. Eligible studies were any randomised controlled trial including adults preparing for major surgery who were allocated to prehabilitation interventions or usual care, and where critical outcomes were reported.\nResults: 186 unique randomised controlled trials with 15 684 participants were included. When comparing treatments using random-effects network meta-analysis, isolated exercise (odds ratio 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.64); very low certainty of evidence), isolated nutritional (0.62 (0.50 to 0.77); very low certainty of evidence), and combined exercise, nutrition, plus psychosocial (0.64 (0.45 to 0.92); very low certainty of evidence) prehabilitation were most likely to reduce complications compared with usual care. Combined exercise and psychosocial (-2.44 days (95% CI -3.85 to -1.04); very low certainty of evidence), combined exercise and nutrition (-1.22 days (-2.54 to 0.10); moderate certainty of evidence), isolated exercise (-0.93 days (-1.27 to -0.58); very low certainty of evidence), and isolated nutritional prehabilitation (-0.99 days (-1.49 to -0.48); very low certainty of evidence) were most likely to decrease length of stay. Combined exercise, nutrition, plus psychosocial prehabilitation was most likely to improve health related quality of life (mean difference on Short Form-36 physical component scale 3.48 (95% CI 0.82 to 6.14); very low certainty of evidence) and physical recovery (mean difference in meters on the six min walk test 43.43 (95% CI 5.96 to 80.91); very low certainty of evidence).When comparing individual components using component network meta-analysis, exercise and nutrition were the individual components most likely to improve all critical outcomes. The certainty of evidence for all comparisons across all outcomes was generally low to very low due to trial level risk of bias and imprecision; however, results for exercise and nutritional prehabilitation were robust with exclusion of high risk of bias trials.\nConclusions: Consistent and potentially meaningful effect estimates suggest that exercise prehabilitation, nutritional prehabilitation, and multicomponent interventions including exercise may benefit adults preparing for surgery and could be considered in clinical care. However, multicentre trials that are appropriately powered for high priority outcomes and that have a low risk of bias are required to have greater certainty in prehabilitation's efficacy.\nRegistration: International prospective registry of systematic reviews CRD42023353710."

Here we sought to define the prognostic roles of clinical, neuroimaging, pathological, and molecular features of these tumors.\nMethods: We retrospectively assembled a cohort of 114 patients (median age 22 years) with diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3 G34-mutant, CNS WHO grade 4 and profiled the imaging, histological and molecular landscape of their tumors.\nResults: Compared with glioblastoma, H3 G34-mutant diffuse hemispheric gliomas exhibited less avid contrast enhancement, necrosis and edema on MRI. Comprehensive analyses of mutational and DNA copy number profiles revealed recurrent mutations in TP53 and ATRX, homozygous deletions of CDKN2A/B, and amplifications of PDGFRA, EGFR, CCND2, and MYCN. MGMT promoter methylation was detected in 79 tumors (75%); 11 tumors (13%) showed DNA copy number profiles suggestive of circumscribed deletions on 10q26.3 involving the MGMT locus. Median survival was 21.5 months. Female sex, gross total resection, and MGMT promoter methylation were positive prognostic factors on univariate analysis. Among radiological, pathological and molecular features, absence of pial invasion, and presence of microvascular proliferation and CDK6 amplification were positive prognostic factors on univariate analyses.\nConclusions: This study refines the clinical and molecular landscape of H3 G34-mutant diffuse hemispheric gliomas. Dedicated trials for this novel tumor type are urgently needed."

Based on visual field assessment, 19 OAG eyes and 21 HMG eyes were determined to be progressive.\nMethods: Mean and sectoral pRNFL and mGC-IPL thicknesses were obtained using swept-source optical coherence tomography. A linear mixed-effects model was used to compare the thinning rates and percentages between groups.\nMain outcome measures: Mean and sectoral thinning rates and percentages of pRNFL and mGC-IPL in HM, OAG, and HMG eyes.\nResults: The mean age of the participants was 37.2 ± 11.2 years, and the mean follow-up duration was 3.2 ± 0.3 years. The mean pRNFL thickness changed at rates of -0.44, -0.63 and -1.17 μm/year in the HM, OAG, and HMG group, respectively (P < 0.001), while the mean mGC-IPL thickness changed at rates of -0.10, -0.32 and -0.41 μm/year in the three groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Temporal pRNFL thinning was faster in HMG compared to OAG (-1.24 μm/year vs -0.45 μm/year, P = 0.002). The mGC-IPL thinning rate in each sector was not significantly different between HMG and OAG group (all Ps > 0.05). In contrast to OAG, HMG eyes showed greater percentage thinning rates of pRNFL in the inferior and temporal sectors, with a greater mGC-IPL thinning in the inferonasal sector.\nConclusions: The patterns of pRNFL and mGC-IPL thinning differ between HMG and OAG. In particular, faster temporal pRNFL thinning may serve as a distinguishing feature for identifying glaucoma in HM eyes. These findings may also enhance the understanding of the mechanisms of damage in HMG."

    "abstract": "SET proteins are lysine methyltransferases. In investigating Leishmania donovani SET29, we found depletion of LdSET29 by two-thirds did not affect promastigote growth, nor alter the parasite's response to UV-induced or HU-induced stress, but made it more tolerant to H2O2-induced oxidizing environment. The deviant response to oxidative stress was coupled to lowered accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which was linked to enhanced scavenging activity. The set29 mutants' response to H2O2 exposure was similar to that of set7 mutants, prompting an investigation into genetic and physical interactions between the two proteins. While neither protein could rescue the aberrant phenotypes of the other set mutant, the two proteins interacted physically in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptome analyses revealed that neither protein regulated global gene expression, but LdSET7 controlled transcript levels of a limited number of genes, including several peroxidases. In working towards identifying targets through which SET7/SET29 mediate the cell's response to an oxidative milieu, we found HSP60/CNP60 and TCP1 to be possible candidates. LdHSP60 has earlier been implicated in the regulation of the response of virulent promastigotes to H2O2 exposure, and LdTCP1 has previously been found to have a protective effect against oxidative stress. set7 and set29 mutants survived more proficiently in host macrophages as well. The data suggest an alliance between LdSET29 and LdSET7 in mounting the parasite's response to oxidative stress, each protein playing its own distinctive role. They ensure the parasite not only establishes infection, but also maintains the balance with host cells to enable the persistence of infection."

    "abstract": "Low temperature severely limits the growth, yield, and geographical distribution of maize (Zea mays L.). How maize adapts to cold climates remains largely unclear. Here, we identify a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, COLD-RESPONSIVE OPERATION LOCUS 1 (COOL1), as a crucial regulator of maize cold tolerance through genome-wide association studies. Natural variations in the COOL1 promoter affect the binding affinity of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5), a transcriptional factor repressing COOL1 transcription. COOL1, in turn, negatively regulates downstream cold-responsive genes, thereby modulating cold tolerance. Moreover, calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK17 translocates to the nucleus and stabilizes COOL1 in response to cold stress. Intriguingly, the cold-tolerant allele of COOL1 is predominantly distributed in northern high latitudes with cold climates. This study defines a previously unknown pathway by which the COOL1-centered module regulates cold tolerance for high latitudinal adaptation in maize."

Our study investigates ET's effects on healthspan in aged animals, revealing lifespan extension and enhanced mobility in Caenorhabditis elegans, accompanied by improved stress resistance and reduced age-associated biomarkers. In aged rats, ET administration enhances exercise endurance, muscle mass, and vascularization, concomitant with higher NAD+ levels in muscle. Mechanistically, ET acts as an alternative substrate for cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), stimulating H2S production, which increases protein persulfidation of more than 300 protein targets. Among these, protein-persulfidation-driven activation of cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (cGPDH) primarily contributes to the ET-induced NAD+ increase. ET's effects are abolished in models lacking CSE or cGPDH, highlighting the essential role of H2S signaling and protein persulfidation. These findings elucidate ET's multifaceted actions and provide insights into its therapeutic potential for combating age-related muscle decline and metabolic perturbations."

The safety of abelacimab as compared with a direct oral anticoagulant in patients with atrial fibrillation is unknown.\nMethods: Patients with atrial fibrillation and a moderate-to-high risk of stroke were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous injection of abelacimab (150 mg or 90 mg once monthly) administered in a blinded fashion or oral rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) administered in an open-label fashion. The primary end point was major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.\nResults: A total of 1287 patients underwent randomization; the median age was 74 years, and 44% were women. At 3 months, the median reduction in free factor XI levels with abelacimab at a dose of 150 mg was 99% (interquartile range, 98 to 99) and with abelacimab at a dose of 90 mg was 97% (interquartile range, 51 to 99). The trial was stopped early on the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee because of a greater-than-anticipated reduction in bleeding events with abelacimab. The incidence rate of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was 3.2 events per 100 person-years with 150-mg abelacimab and 2.6 events per 100 person-years with 90-mg abelacimab, as compared with 8.4 events per 100 person-years with rivaroxaban (hazard ratio for 150-mg abelacimab vs. rivaroxaban, 0.38 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.24 to 0.60]; hazard ratio for 90-mg abelacimab vs. rivaroxaban, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.19 to 0.51]; P<0.001 for both comparisons). The incidence and severity of adverse events appeared to be similar in the three groups.\nConclusions: Among patients with atrial fibrillation who were at moderate-to-high risk for stroke, treatment with abelacimab resulted in markedly lower levels of free factor XI and fewer bleeding events than treatment with rivaroxaban.

An important question is whether perioperative chemotherapy is preferable to preoperative chemoradiotherapy.\nMethods: In this phase 3, multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned in a 1:1 ratio patients with resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma to receive perioperative chemotherapy with FLOT (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel) plus surgery or preoperative chemoradiotherapy (radiotherapy at a dose of 41.4 Gy and carboplatin and paclitaxel) plus surgery. Eligibility criteria included a primary tumor with a clinical stage of cT1 cN+, cT2-4a cN+, or cT2-4a cN0 disease, in which T indicates the size and extent of the tumor (higher numbers indicate a more advanced tumor), and N indicates the presence (N+) or absence (N0) of cancer spread to the lymph nodes, without evidence of metastatic spread. The primary end point was overall survival.\nResults: From February 2016 through April 2020, we assigned 221 patients to the FLOT group and 217 patients to the preoperative-chemoradiotherapy group. With a median follow-up of 55 months, overall survival at 3 years was 57.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.1 to 64.0) in the FLOT group and 50.7% (95% CI, 43.5 to 57.5) in the preoperative-chemoradiotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.92; P = 0.01). Progression-free survival at 3 years was 51.6% (95% CI, 44.3 to 58.4) in the FLOT group and 35.0% (95% CI, 28.4 to 41.7) in the preoperative-chemoradiotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.85). Among the patients who started the assigned treatment, grade 3 or higher adverse events were observed in 120 of 207 patients (58.0%) in the FLOT group and in 98 of 196 patients (50.0%) in the preoperative-chemoradiotherapy group.

Participants were recruited face-to-face from primary care centers in Barcelona, Spain, between July 2021 and March 2022. They were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: (1) an intervention group (n=61) instructed to use the Greenhabit mobile app alongside standard care, or (2) a control group (n=62) who received advice on maintaining a healthy diet and followed standard care. The Greenhabit app incorporates serious gaming technology. Participants received daily messages and challenges focused on promoting a healthy lifestyle, including nutrition, exercise, relaxation, a positive mindset, and a supportive social environment. The app encouraged participants to set weekly goals and awarded points for completing challenges. Data on nutrition, anthropometrics, and blood and urine samples were collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Questionnaires assessing quality of life, work-life balance, and social environment were administered at baseline and during the final visit. The primary outcomes were HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare changes over time (baseline to 6 weeks and baseline to 12 weeks) between the 2 intervention groups. Analysis of covariance was performed to evaluate changes at 6 and 12 weeks, adjusted for baseline levels of each variable. Multiple contrasts were corrected using a Bonferroni post hoc test.\nResults: Both groups showed significant reductions in HbA1c after 6 and 12 weeks (mean change in the intervention group [n=50] -0.4%, P<.001 vs -0.3% in the control group [n=53], P=.001) and in FPG after 6 weeks (mean change in the intervention group -5.3 mg/dL, P=.01 vs control group -5.8 mg/dL, P=.01). At 12 weeks, the intervention group also showed significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mean change -4.5, P=.049 and -2.4 mmHg, P=.03, respectively), body weight (mean change -0.8 kg, P=.03), BMI (mean change -0.3 kg/m2, P=.03), waist circumference (mean change -1.0 cm, P=.046), and triglyceride concentration (mean change -20.0 mg/dL, P=.03). There was also a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations (mean change 2 mg/dL, P=.049). Finally, improvements were noted in 3 out of the 5 elements of balance: positivity, social environment, and work-life balance.\nConclusions: The 12-week intervention with the Greenhabit behavioral treatment mHealth app showed beneficial effects on T2D outcomes and reduced the burden of cardiovascular risk factors. Although larger studies are warranted, these results suggest that mHealth apps can be a promising tool for improving T2D self-management.\nTrial registration: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN13456652; http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN13456652."

The search was limited to RCTs evaluating the use of GLP-1 RAs for mean differences from baseline in weight, BMI, and waist circumference in adults with obesity or overweight with or without diabetes. Two independent reviewers performed the literature search and data extraction, resolving disagreements via consensus or third-reviewer consultation.\nResults: Forty-seven RCTs were included, with a combined cohort of 23,244 patients. GLP-1 RAs demonstrated a mean weight reduction of -4.57 kg (95% CI -5.35 to -3.78), mean BMI reduction of -2.07 kg/m2 (95% CI -2.53 to -1.62), and mean waist circumference reduction of -4.55 cm (95% CI -5.72 to -3.38) compared with placebo. This effect was consistent across diabetes status, GLP-1 RA used, and route of administration. The greatest treatment benefit appeared to favor patients who were younger, female, without diabetes, with higher baseline weight and BMI but lower baseline HbA1c, and treated over a longer duration. Limitations include substantial statistical heterogeneity, in part due to broad inclusion criteria. However, this heterogeneity may improve generalizability by reflecting a wide range of study designs and patient populations.\nConclusions: GLP-1 RAs demonstrated significant weight, BMI, and waist circumference reduction benefits in this meta-analysis."

    "abstract": "A major limiting factor in the success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for the treatment of solid tumors is targeting tumor antigens also found on normal tissues. CAR T cells against GD2 induced rapid, fatal neurotoxicity because of CAR recognition of GD2+ normal mouse brain tissue. To improve the selectivity of the CAR T cell, we engineered a synthetic Notch receptor that selectively expresses the CAR upon binding to P-selectin, a cell adhesion protein overexpressed in tumor neovasculature. These tumor microenvironment actuated T (MEAT) cells ameliorated T cell infiltration in the brain, preventing fatal neurotoxicity while maintaining antitumor efficacy. We found that conditional CAR expression improved the persistence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes because of enhanced metabolic fitness of MEAT cells and the infusion of a less differentiated product. This approach increases the repertoire of targetable solid tumor antigens by restricting CAR expression and subsequent killing to cancer cells only and provides a proof-of-concept model for other targets."

We found that a direct circuit from the tongue → glutamatergic neurons in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (MTNGlu) → noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LCNE) drives rapid arousal in the anesthetized mice that receive the rescue-like behavior from bystanders. Artificial inhibition of this circuit abolishes the rapid arousal effect induced by the rescue-like behavior. Further, we revealed that glutamatergic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVTGlu) that project to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) mediate the rescue-like behavior. These findings reveal a tongue-brain connection underlying the rapid arousal effects induced by rescue-like behavior and the circuit basis governing this specific form of prosocial behavior."

    "abstract": "Human health is being threatened by environmental microplastic (MP) pollution. MPs were detected in the bloodstream and multiple tissues of humans, disrupting the regular physiological processes of organs. Nanoscale plastics can breach the blood-brain barrier, leading to neurotoxic effects. How MPs cause brain functional irregularities remains unclear. This work uses high-depth imaging techniques to investigate the MPs within the brain in vivo. We show that circulating MPs are phagocytosed and lead these cells to obstruction in the capillaries of the brain cortex. These blockages as thrombus formation cause reduced blood flow and neurological abnormalities in mice. Our data reveal a mechanism by which MPs disrupt tissue function indirectly through regulation of cell obstruction and interference with local blood circulation, rather than direct tissue penetration. This revelation offers a lens through which to comprehend the toxicological implications of MPs that invade the bloodstream."

    "abstract": "Protein homeostasis is crucial for maintaining cardiomyocyte (CM) function. Disruption of proteostasis results in accumulation of protein aggregates causing cardiac pathologies such as hypertrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and heart failure. Here, we identify ubiquitin-specific peptidase 5 (USP5) as a critical determinant of protein quality control (PQC) in CM. CM-specific loss of mUsp5 leads to the accumulation of polyubiquitin chains and protein aggregates, cardiac remodeling, and eventually DCM. USP5 interacts with key components of the proteostasis machinery, including PSMD14, and the absence of USP5 increases activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagic flux in CMs. Cardiac-specific hUSP5 overexpression reduces pathological remodeling in pressure-overloaded mouse hearts and attenuates protein aggregate formation in titinopathy and desminopathy models. Since CMs from humans with end-stage DCM show lower USP5 levels and display accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, we hypothesize that therapeutically increased USP5 activity may reduce protein aggregates during DCM. Our findings demonstrate that USP5 is essential for ubiquitin turnover and proteostasis in mature CMs."

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-β (Aβ) triggers the aggregation and spreading of tau pathology, which drives neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. However, the pathophysiological link between Aβ and tau remains unclear, which hinders therapeutic efforts to attenuate Aβ-related tau accumulation. Aβ has been found to trigger neuronal hyperactivity and hyperconnectivity, and preclinical research has shown that tau spreads across connected neurons in an activity-dependent manner. Here, we hypothesized that neuronal hyperactivity and hypersynchronicity, resulting in functional connectivity increases, constitute a crucial mechanism by which Aβ facilitates the spreading of tau pathology. By combining Aβ positron emission tomography (PET), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and longitudinal tau-PET in 69 cognitively normal amyloid-negative controls and 140 amyloid-positive patients covering the AD spectrum, we confirmed that Aβ induces hyperconnectivity of temporal lobe tau epicenters to posterior brain regions that are vulnerable to tau accumulation in AD. This was replicated in an independent sample of 55 controls and 345 individuals with preclinical AD and low cortical tau-PET uptake, suggesting that the emergence of Aβ-related hyperconnectivity precedes neocortical tau spreading . Last, using longitudinal tau-PET and mediation analysis, we confirmed that these Aβ-related connectivity increases in tau epicenters to typical tau-vulnerable brain regions in AD mediated the effect of Aβ on faster tau accumulation, unveiling increased connectivity as a potential causal link between the two AD hallmark pathologies. Together, these findings suggest that Aβ promotes tau spreading by eliciting neuronal hyperconnectivity and that targeting Aβ-related neuronal hyperconnectivity may attenuate tau spreading in AD."

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies have revolutionized the landscape of cancer treatment, in particular in the context of hematologic malignancies. However, for solid tumors that lack tumor-specific antigens, CAR-T cells can infiltrate and attack nonmalignant tissues expressing the CAR target antigen, leading to on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Severe on-target, off-tumor toxicities have been observed in clinical trials of CAR-T therapy for solid tumors, highlighting the need to address this issue. Here, we demonstrated that targeting the cell adhesion and migration molecules lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1; CD11a/CD18) and very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4; CD49d/CD29) with blocking antibodies reduced the on-target, off-tumor toxicity of CAR-T cells in mice. To translate this observation into improved CAR-T cell therapy, we either knocked out both CD11a and CD49d or knocked down CD11a and CD49d along with PSGL1, another cell adhesion molecule, in CAR-T cells. We found that these modified CAR-T cells exhibited reduced on-target, off-tumor toxicity in vivo without affecting CAR-T cell efficacy. Furthermore, we showed that this approach promoted T cell memory formation and decreased tonic signaling. On the basis of these data, we engineered a human version of these low-toxicity CAR-T cells and further validated the feasibility of this approach in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results provide a potential solution to address the clinical challenge of on-target, off-tumor toxicity in CAR-T therapy."

    "abstract": "In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), repeated cycles of infection and inflammation eventually lead to fatal lung damage. Although diminished mucus clearance can be restored by highly effective CFTR modulator therapy, inflammation and infection often persist. To elucidate the role of the innate immune system in CF etiology, we investigated a CF pig model and compared these results with those for preschool children with CF. In newborn CF pigs, we observed changes in lung immune cell composition before the onset of infection that were dominated by increased monocyte infiltration, whereas neutrophil numbers remained constant. Flow cytometric and transcriptomic profiling revealed that the infiltrating myeloid cells displayed a more immature status. Cells with comparably immature transcriptomic profiles were enriched in the blood of CF pigs at birth as well as in preschool children with CF. This pattern coincided with decreased CD16 expression in the myeloid cells of both pigs and humans, which translated into lower phagocytic activity and reduced production of reactive oxygen species in both species. These results were indicative of a congenital, translationally conserved, and functionally relevant aberration of the immune system in CF. In newborn wild-type pigs, CFTR transcription in immune cells, including lung-derived and circulating monocytes, isolated from the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and blood was below the detection limits of highly sensitive assays, suggesting an indirect etiology of the observed effects. Our findings highlight the need for additional immunological treatments to target innate immune deficits in patients with CF."

Other postviral and autoimmune conditions have a female predominance, but whether the same is true for long COVID, especially within different subgroups, is uncertain.\nObjective: To evaluate sex differences in the risk of developing long COVID among adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nDesign, setting, and participants: This cohort study used data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER)-Adult cohort, which consists of individuals enrolled in and prospectively followed up at 83 sites in 33 US states plus Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. Data were examined from all participants enrolled between October 29, 2021, and July 5, 2024, who had a qualifying study visit 6 months or more after their initial SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nExposure: Self-reported sex (male, female) assigned at birth.\nMain outcomes and measures: Development of long COVID, measured using a self-reported symptom-based questionnaire and scoring guideline at the first study visit that occurred at least 6 months after infection. Propensity score matching was used to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (95% CIs). The full model included demographic and clinical characteristics and social determinants of health, and the reduced model included only age, race, and ethnicity.\nResults: Among 12 276 participants who had experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection (8969 [73%] female; mean [SD] age at infection, 46 [15] years), female sex was associated with higher risk of long COVID in the primary full (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06-1.62) and reduced (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.17-1.77) models. This finding was observed across all age groups except 18 to 39 years (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.72-1.49). Female sex was associated with significantly higher overall long COVID risk when the analysis was restricted to nonpregnant participants (RR, 1.50; 95%: CI, 1.27-1.77). Among participants aged 40 to 54 years, the risk ratio was 1.42 (95% CI, 0.99-2.03) in menopausal female participants and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.15-1.83) in nonmenopausal female participants compared with male participants.\nConclusions and relevance: In this prospective cohort study of the NIH RECOVER-Adult cohort, female sex was associated with an increased risk of long COVID compared with male sex, and this association was age, pregnancy, and menopausal status dependent. These findings highlight the need to identify biological mechanisms contributing to sex specificity to facilitate risk stratification, targeted drug development, and improved management of long COVID."

Data from 15 research and memory clinic studies were pooled and harmonized. Participants included individuals for whom data on age, cognitive status, amyloid status, and presence of CMBs were available. Data were analyzed from October 22, 2023, to April 26, 2024.\nMain outcomes and measures: The main outcomes were age, cognitive status, amyloid status and presence, location, and number of CMBs. Presence of amyloid pathology was determined based on 42 amino acid-long form of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ42) levels in cerebrospinal fluid or on amyloid-positron emission tomography. Presence and, in a subset, location (lobar vs deep) and number of CMBs were determined on magnetic resonance imaging (locally with visual rating).\nResults: Among 4080 participants included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 66.5 (8.9) years, and 2241 (54.9%) were female. A total of 2973 participants had no cognitive impairment (cognitive unimpairment [CU]), and 1107 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD dementia (ADD). One thousand five hundred and thirteen participants (37.1%) had amyloid pathology, 1368 of 3599 (38.0%) with data available were APOE ε4 carriers, and 648 (15.9%) had CMBs. In the CU group, amyloid pathology and APOE ε4 copy number were not associated with presence of any, no more than 4, or fewer than 2 CMBs but were associated with increased odds of lobar CMBs (odds ratio [OR] for amyloid, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.20-1.69], P < .001; OR for 2 vs 0 alleles, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.19-2.74], P = .006; OR for 1 vs 0 alleles, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.83-1.46], P = .49; and OR for 2 vs 1 allele, 1.64 [95% CI, 0.90-2.97], P = .11; overall P = .02).

APOE ε4 copy number was associated with presence of any (OR for 2 vs 0 alleles, 1.72 [95% CI, 0.88-3.35], P = .11; OR for 1 vs 0 alleles, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.59-1.04], P = .09; and OR for 2 vs 1 allele, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.32-3.67], P = .002; overall P < .001) and no more than 4 CMBs (OR for 2 vs 0 alleles, 1.31 [95% CI, 0.64-2.68], P = .45; OR for 1 vs 0 alleles, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.54-1.04], P = .08; and OR for 2 vs 1 allele, 1.76 [95% CI, 0.97-3.19], P = .06; overall P = .03) but not with fewer than 2 or lobar CMBs. Prevalence estimates of CMBs ranged from 6% at 50 years of age in a non-APOE ε4 allele carrier with no amyloid pathology and no cognitive impairment to 52% at 90 years of age in an APOE ε4 homozygote carrier with amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment.\nConclusions and relevance: In this cross-sectional study of 4080 participants, prevalence estimates of CMBs were associated with amyloid status, APOE ε4 copy number, and age. CMB prevalence estimates may help inform safety evaluations for antiamyloid clinical trials."

Whether hypertension while supine is a risk factor associated with CVD independent of seated hypertension remains unknown.\nObjective: To investigate the association between supine hypertension and CVD outcomes and by hypertension treatment status.\nDesign, setting, and participants: This prospective cohort study used data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, which was established in 1987 to examine cardiovascular risk factors among middle-aged adults from 4 communities in the US. Supine and seated blood pressure were measured in more than 13 000 middle-aged adults with longitudinal surveillance for CVD over 27 years. Participants with a history of coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, or stroke were excluded. Data were analyzed from May 2023 through December 2024.\nExposures: Supine hypertension (supine systolic blood pressure ≥130 or diastolic blood pressure ≥80 mm Hg) with and without seated hypertension (seated systolic blood pressure ≥130 or diastolic blood pressure ≥80 mm Hg).\nMain outcomes and measures: Cox proportional hazard models with adjustment for CVD risk factors were performed to investigate the association of supine hypertension with and without seated hypertension with incident CHD, heart failure, stroke, fatal CHD, and all-cause mortality.\nResults: Of 11 369 participants without known CVD (6332 female [55.7%] and 5037 male [44.3%]; 2858 Black [25.1%] and 8511 White [74.9%]; mean [SD] age 53.9 [5.7] years]), 16.4% (95% CI, 15.5%-17.2%) of those without seated hypertension had supine hypertension and 73.5% (95% CI, 72.2%-74.8%) of those with seated hypertension had supine hypertension. Supine hypertension was associated with incident CHD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.60; 95% CI, 1.45-1.76), heart failure (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.68-2.01), stroke (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.63-2.13), fatal CHD (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.84-2.59), and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.35-1.52) during a median (25th, 75th percentile) follow-up of 25.7 (15.4, 30.4) years, 26.9 (17.6, 30.5) years, 27.6 (18.5, 30.6 years), 28.3 (20.5, 30.7) years, and 28.3 (20.5 years, 30.7) years, respectively. There were no meaningful differences by seated hypertension status. Results were similar by hypertension medication use. Participants with supine hypertension alone had risk associations similar to those of participants with hypertension in both positions and significantly greater than those of participants with seated hypertension alone with the exception of fatal CHD; seated vs supine HRs were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.61-0.85) for CHD, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.60-0.85) for heart failure, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.51-0.86) for stroke, and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92) for all-cause mortality.\nConclusions and relevance: Supine hypertension regardless of seated hypertension had a higher HR for CVD risk than seated hypertension alone. Future research should evaluate supine hypertension in the setting of nocturnal hypertension and as an independent target of blood pressure treatment."

The phase III IFM2020-02-MIDAS study (NCT04934475) assessed a minimal residual disease (MRD)-driven consolidation and maintenance strategy following induction with isatuximab, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (IsaKRD). Here, we report safety and efficacy outcomes of six 28-day cycles of IsaKRD. Between December 2021 and July 2023, 791 patients were enrolled across 72 centers. The median age was 59 years; 13% had ISS-stage III, 5% had R-ISS-stage III, and 8% had high-risk cytogenetics (IFM Linear Predictor cytogenetic score >1). Overall, 96% (N=757) of patients completed induction. The median CD34+ cell yield was 7 × 106/Kg, with 94% of patients able to proceed with a potential tandem transplant. The best overall response rate was 95%. In the intent-to-treat population, 91% achieved a very good partial response or better after induction, with MRD-negativity rates of 63% at 10-5 and 47% at 10-6. MRD-negativity rates differed across ISS stages and cytogenetic subgroups. During induction, 7 patients experienced disease progression, and 5 died due to disease progression (N=1), cardiac events (N=2), or other causes (N=2). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (25%), thrombocytopenia (5%), and infections (7%); only 13% of patients reported any grade peripheral neuropathy. IsaKRD induction yielded deep responses and high MRD-negativity rates while ensuring successful stem cell collection, with no new safety signals. Continued follow-up of this ongoing study is required to confirm these findings."

We uncovered a direct mechanistic link between expression of the stem cell transcription factor GATA2 and drug resistance. The GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA2) plays a central role in blood stem cell generation and maintenance. We find substantial intra- and inter-patient variability in GATA2 expression across AML patient samples. GATA2 expression varies by molecular subtype and has been linked to outcome. In a murine model, KMT2A-MLL3 driven AML originating from a stem cell or immature progenitor cell population have higher Gata2 expression and are more resistant to the standard AML chemotherapy agent doxorubicin. Deletion of Gata2 resulted in more robust induction of p53 following exposure to doxorubicin. ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq and functional studies revealed that GATA2 regulates the expression of RASSF4, a modulator of the p53 inhibitor MDM2. GATA2 and RASSF4 are anti-correlated in human cell lines and AML patient cell bulk and single cell expression datasets. Knockdown of Rassf4 in Gata2 low cells resulted in doxorubicin or nutlin-3 resistance. Conversely, overexpression of Rassf4 results in sensitization of cells expressing high levels of Gata2. Finally, doxorubicin and nutlin-3 are synergistic in Gata2-high murine AML, as well as AML patient samples. We discovered a previously unappreciated role for GATA2 in dampening p53-mediated apoptosis via transcriptional regulation of RASSF4, a modulator of MDM2. This role for GATA2 directly links the expression of a stemness associated transcription factor to chemotherapy resistance."

At the time of analysis, 95 centers were included in the Amyloid Biomarker Study. The study included 9746 individuals with normal cognition (NC) and 3023 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) aged between 34 and 100 years for whom data on amyloid biomarkers, presence of depressive symptoms, and age were available. Data were analyzed from December 2022 to February 2024.\nMain outcomes and measures: Amyloid-β1-42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid positron emission tomography scans were used to determine presence or absence of amyloid pathology. Presence of depressive symptoms was determined on the basis of validated depression rating scale scores, evidence of a current clinical diagnosis of depression, or self-reported depressive symptoms.\nResults: In individuals with NC (mean [SD] age, 68.6 [8.9] years; 5664 [58.2%] female; 3002 [34.0%] APOE ε4 carriers; 937 [9.6%] had depressive symptoms; 2648 [27.2%] had amyloid pathology), the presence of depressive symptoms was not associated with amyloid pathology (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% CI, 0.90-1.40; P = .29).

While BRAF inhibitors are effective in BRAF-mutant melanoma patients, intrinsic or acquired resistance to these therapies is common. Here, we identify non-receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase 23 (PTPN23) as an alternative effective target in BRAF-mutant cancer cells. Silencing PTPN23 selectively kills BRAF-mutant melanoma cells but not those with wild-type BRAF. Mechanistically, PTPN23, a catalytically inactive phosphatase, intriguingly induces WNK3-mediated phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase class II alpha (PI3KC2α) at serine 329, enhancing its catalytic activity. This activation promotes production of PI(3,4)P2 and subsequent AKT2 activation at endosomes to support cell survival. Genetic or pharmacological targeting of the PTPN23-PI3KC2α-AKT2 signaling axis, alone or in combination with BRAF inhibitors, effectively inhibits the growth of BRAF-mutant melanoma and other cancers in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrate that melanocyte-specific knockout of PTPN23 significantly inhibits BRAFV600E-driven melanomagenesis. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that targeting PTPN23/PI3KC2α offers a new and viable therapeutic strategy for BRAF-mutant cancers."

We report that exposure to sodium itaconate (ITA) interferes with the central carbon metabolism of M. tuberculosis. In addition to the inhibition of isocitrate lyase (ICL), we demonstrate that itaconate inhibits aldolase and inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase in a concentration-dependent manner. Previous studies have shown that Rv2498c from M. tuberculosis is the bona fide (S)-citramalyl-CoA lyase, but the remaining components of the pathway remain elusive. Here, we report that Rv2503c and Rv3272 possess itaconate:succinyl-CoA transferase activity, and Rv2499c and Rv3389c possess itaconyl-CoA hydratase activity. Relative to the parental and complemented strains, the ΔRv3389c strain of M. tuberculosis was attenuated for growth in itaconate-containing medium, in macrophages, mice, and guinea pigs. The attenuated phenotype of ΔRv3389c strain of M. tuberculosis is associated with a defect in the itaconate dissimilation and propionyl-CoA detoxification pathway. This study thus reveals that multiple metabolic enzymes are targeted by itaconate in M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, we have assigned the two remaining enzymes responsible for the degradation of itaconic acid into pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. Finally, we also demonstrate the importance of enzymes involved in the itaconate dissimilation pathway for M. tuberculosis pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) fuel acute myeloid leukemia (AML) growth and relapse, but therapies tailored towards eradicating LSCs without harming normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are lacking. FLT3 is considered an important therapeutic target due to frequent mutation in AML and association with relapse. However, there has been limited clinical success with FLT3 drug targeting, suggesting either that FLT3 is not a vulnerability in LSC, or that more potent inhibition is required, a scenario where HSC toxicity could become limiting. We tested these possibilities by ablating FLT3 using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated FLT3 knock-out (FLT3-KO) in human LSCs and HSCs followed by functional xenograft assays. FLT3-KO in LSCs from FLT3-ITD mutated, but not FLT3-wild type (WT) AMLs, resulted in short-term leukemic grafts of FLT3-KO edited cells that disappeared by 12 weeks. By contrast, FLT3-KO in HSCs from fetal liver, cord blood and adult bone marrow did not impair multilineage hematopoiesis in primary and secondary xenografts. Our study establishes FLT3 as an ideal therapeutic target where ITD+ LSC are eradicated upon FLT3 deletion, while HSCs are spared. These findings support the development of more potent FLT3-targeting drugs or gene-editing approaches for LSC eradication to improve clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "Platelets are crucial players in hemostasis and thrombosis, but also contribute to immune regulation and host defense, using different receptors, signaling pathways and effector functions, respectively. Whether distinct subsets of platelets specialize in these diverse tasks is insufficiently understood. Here, we employed an in vivo pulse-labelling method in Mus musculus models for tracking in vivo platelet ageing and its functional implications. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we reveal that young, reticulated platelets show heightened responses in the setting of clot formation, with corresponding, increased responses to agonists, adhesion, and retractile function. Unexpectedly, aged platelets lose their hemostatic proficiency but are more prone to react to inflammatory challenge: compared to reticulated platelets, this cohort was more likely to form platelet-leukocyte aggregates and showed increased adhesion to neutrophils in vitro, as well as enhanced bactericidal function. In vivo, this was reflected in increased pulmonary recruitment of aged platelets in an acute lung injury model. Proteomic analyses confirmed upregulation of immune pathways in this cohort, including enhanced procoagulant function. In mouse models of prolonged platelet half-life, this resulted in increased pulmonary leukocyte infiltration and inflammation upon acute lung injury. Similarly, human platelet concentrates decreased their hemostatic function and elevated their putative immunomodulatory potential in vitro over time, and in a mouse model of platelet transfusion, aged platelet concentrates resulted in augmented inflammation. In summary, we show that platelets exhibit age-dependent phenotypic shifts allowing them to fulfill their diverse tasks in the vasculature. As functional alterations of aging platelets extend to platelet concentrates, this may hold important implications for transfusion medicine."

    "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are age-related diseases characterized by bone marrow (BM) dysfunction and an increased risk of developing acute leukemia. While there is growing evidence highlighting the crucial role of the BM microenvironment (BMME) in MDS, the specific influence of inflammation on BMME changes, as well as the potential benefits of targeting cytokines therapeutically, remain to be elucidated. We previously found interleukin-1 (IL-1) to be a driver of aging phenotypes of BMME and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). In the current study, BM samples from patients with MDS demonstrated upregulated levels of IL-1 family cytokines including IL-18. Utilizing highly purified primary BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), both interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and IL-18 were found to exert direct effects on MSCs, thus influencing their ability to support HSPCs as well as erythroid progenitors. This confirms the significant involvement of both these IL-1 family cytokines in regulating the BM niche. Furthermore, targeting IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1R1) mitigated these aging phenotypes in elderly mice. We subsequently employed an age-appropriate murine model of MDS by transplanting NUP98-HOXD13 transgenic mice (NHD13Tg) cells into aged wild-type mice. Treatment with inhibitors targeting interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) reversed the proliferation of dysfunctional MSCs and enhanced their functionality. Additionally, IRAK4 inhibition selectively suppressed MDS clonal cells while sparing non-MDS cells in the BM. These findings suggest that targeting IL-1 signaling holds promise for MDS treatment by addressing the underlying myeloid malignancy and restoring the altered BMME via BM-MSCs."

    "abstract": "Gaudichaudione H (GH) is a naturally occurring small molecular compound derived from Garcinia oligantha Merr. (Clusiaceae), but the full pharmacological functions remain unclear. Herein, the potential of GH in disulfidptosis regulation, a novel form of programmed cell death induced by disulfide stress is explored. The omics results indicated that NRF2 signaling could be significantly activated by GH. The potential targets are associated with hepatocarcinogenesis and cell death. Moreover, both glutathione (GSH) metabolism and NADP+-NADPH metabolism are affected by GH, indicating the potential in disulfidptosis regulation. It is also observed that GH enhanced the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to disulfidptosis, which is dependent on the activation of NRF2-SLC7A11 pathway. GH significantly increased the levels of NRF2 and promoted the transcription of NRF2 target gene, SLC7A11, through autophagy-mediated non-canonical mechanism. Under the condition of glucose starvation, GH-induced upregulation of SLC7A11 aggravated uptake of cysteine, disturbance of GSH synthesis, depletion of NADPH, and accumulation of disulfide molecules, ultimately leading to the formation of disulfide bonds between different cytoskeleton proteins and disulfidptosis eventually. Collectively, the findings underscore the potential role of GH in promoting cancer cell disulfidptosis, thereby offering a promising avenue for the treatment of drug-resistant HCC in clinical settings."

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) usually creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment, thereby hindering immunotherapy response. Effective treatment options remain elusive. Using scRNA-seq analysis in a tumor-bearing murine model, it is found that lobeline, an alkaloid from the herbal medicine lobelia, promotes polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward M1-like TAMs while inhibiting their polarization toward M2-like TAMs. Additionally, lobeline upregulates mRNA expression of secreted Ly-6/UPAR-related protein 1 (Slurp1) in cancer cells. The inhibitory effects of lobeline on tumor load and TAM polarization are almost completely eliminated when Slurp1-deficient MC38 cells are subcutaneously injected into mice, suggesting that lobeline exerts an antitumor effect in a Slurp1-dependent manner. Furthermore, using target-responsive accessibility profiling, MAPK14 is identified as the direct target protein of lobeline. Mechanistically, upon binding to MAPK14 in colon cancer cells, lobeline prevents nuclear translocation of MAPK14, resulting in decreased levels of phosphorylated p53. Consequently, negative transcriptional regulation of SLURP1 by p53 is suppressed, leading to enhanced transcription and secretion of SLURP1. Finally, combination therapy using lobeline and anti-PD1 exhibits stronger antitumor effects. Taken together, these findings suggest that remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment using small-molecule lobeline may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC."

However, whether the addition of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab to chemotherapy would improve outcomes in high-risk, early-stage, estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer remains unclear. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study (KEYNOTE-756) in which patients with previously untreated ER+/HER2- grade 3 high-risk invasive breast cancer (T1c-2 (≥2 cm), cN1-2 or T3-4, cN0-2) were randomly assigned (1:1) to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo Q3W given with paclitaxel QW for 12 weeks, followed by four cycles of doxorubicin or epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide Q2W or Q3W. After surgery (with/without adjuvant radiation therapy), patients received adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for nine cycles plus adjuvant endocrine therapy. Dual primary endpoints were pathological complete response and event-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. In total, 635 patients were assigned to the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy arm and 643 to the placebo-chemotherapy arm. At the study's prespecified first interim analysis, the pathological complete response rate was 24.3% (95% confidence interval (CI), 21.0-27.8%) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy arm and 15.6% (95% CI, 12.8-18.6%) in the placebo-chemotherapy arm (estimated treatment difference, 8.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 4.2-12.8; P = 0.00005). Event-free survival was not mature in this analysis. During the neoadjuvant phase, treatment-related adverse events of grade ≥3 were reported in 52.5% and 46.4% of patients in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy and placebo-chemotherapy arms, respectively. In summary, the addition of pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved the pathological complete response rate in patients with high-risk, early-stage ER+/HER2- breast cancer. Safety was consistent with the known profiles of each study treatment. Follow-up continues for event-free survival. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03725059 ."

    "abstract": "Maturation of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) is crucial for maintaining tolerogenic safeguards against auto-immunity and for promoting immunogenic responses to pathogens and cancer. The subcellular mechanism for cDC maturation remains poorly defined. We show that cDCs mature by leveraging an internal reservoir of cholesterol (harnessed from extracellular cell debris and generated by de novo synthesis) to assemble lipid nanodomains on cell surfaces of maturing cDCs, enhance expression of maturation markers and stabilize immune receptor signaling. This process is dependent on cholesterol transport through Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) and mediates homeostatic and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced maturation. Importantly, we identified the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL as a regulator of the NPC1-dependent construction of lipid nanodomains. Deleting AXL from cDCs enhances their maturation, thus improving anti-tumor immunity. Altogether, our study presents new insights into cholesterol mobilization as a fundamental basis for cDC maturation and highlights AXL as a therapeutic target for modulating cDCs."

    "abstract": "Serine arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) is a key oncogenic splicing factor in various cancers, promoting abnormal gene expression through post-translational regulation. Although the protumoral function of SRSF1 is well-established, the effects of inhibiting tumor-intrinsic SRSF1 on the tumor microenvironment and its impact on CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity remain unclear. Our findings indicate that depleting SRSF1 in CD8+ T cells improve antitumor immune function, glycolytic metabolism, and the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy. The inactivation of SRSF1 in tumor cells reduces transcription factors, including c-Jun, c-myc, and JunB, facilitating glycolytic metabolism reprogramming, which restores CD8+ T cell function and inhibits tumor growth. The small-molecule inhibitor TN2008 targets SRSF1, boosting antitumor immune responses and improving immunotherapy effectiveness in mouse models. We therefore introduce a paradigm targeting SRSF1 that simultaneously disrupts tumor cell metabolism and enhances the antitumor immunity of CD8+ T cells."

    "abstract": "TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) and Metastasis Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript (MALAT1) RNA are both abundantly expressed in the human cell nucleus. Increased interaction of TDP-43 and MALAT1, as well as dysregulation of TDP-43 function, was previously identified in brain samples from patients with neurodegenerative disease compared to healthy brain tissues. We hypothesized that TDP-43 function may depend in part on MALAT1 expression levels. Here, we find that alterations in MALAT1 expression affect cell viability and can modulate TDP-43 binding to other mRNAs in HEK293 and SH-SH5Y human cell lines. Disruption of either MALAT1 or TDP-43 expression induces cell death, indicating that both macromolecules contribute positively to survival. Depletion of MALAT1 RNA results in increased binding of TDP-43 to other mRNA transcripts at the 3' UTR. Finally, we examined the contribution of MALAT1 expression to survival in a cell culture model of neurodegeneration using MPP+ treatment in SH-SY5Y cells. Depletion of MALAT1 RNA protects against toxicity in a cellular model of neurodegeneration and modulates TDP-43 binding to mRNA transcripts involved in apoptotic cell death. Taken together, we find that MALAT1 RNA and TDP-43 interactions can affect mRNA levels and cell viability. A tightly regulated network of non-coding RNA, messenger RNA, and protein interactions could provide a mechanism to maintain appropriate RNA expression levels and contribute to neuronal function."

Diet, blood pressure, blood glucose and lipids were measured twice, 1-year apart. Arterial stiffness [indicated by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and ankle-brachial index] and liver fat accumulation [indicated by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP)] were measured after 1 year.\nResults: We identified 27 microbial genera whose relative abundance was positively associated with serum HA concentrations (PFDR<0.05) and constructed a microbial score to reflect the overall HA-producing potential. In multivariate-adjusted linear models, dietary intake of catechins and chlorogenic acids was positively associated with serum HA concentrations among participants with a higher microbial score (β=0.26, P=0.03), but not among those with a lower score (β=-0.13, P=0.30, Pinteraction=0.03). Participants with higher intake of dietary catechins and chlorogenic acids had lower triglyceride (Percentage change = -5.9%, P<0.05). Each 1 μmol/L increase in serum HA, but not in BA, was associated with 5.7%, 1.5%, 1.7%, 1.7%, and 1.7% decrease in triglyceride, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, baPWV, and CAP, respectively (all P<0.05).\nConclusions: The gut microbial genera that predicted circulating HA levels may modify the association between dietary polyphenol intake and circulating HA levels, and elevated serum HA concentrations are favorably associated with multiple cardiometabolic risk markers."

We adopted metagenome-informed metaproteomics (MIM), in mice and humans, to non-invasively explore species-level microbiome-host interactions during commensal and pathogen colonization, nutritional modification, and antibiotic-induced perturbation. Simultaneously, fecal MIM accurately characterized the nutritional exposure landscape in multiple clinical and dietary contexts. Implementation of MIM in murine auto-inflammation and in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized a \"compositional dysbiosis\" and a concomitant species-specific \"functional dysbiosis\" driven by suppressed commensal responses to inflammatory host signals. Microbiome transfers unraveled early-onset kinetics of these host-commensal cross-responsive patterns, while predictive analyses identified candidate fecal host-microbiome IBD biomarker protein pairs outperforming S100A8/S100A9 (calprotectin). Importantly, a simultaneous fecal nutritional MIM assessment enabled the determination of IBD-related consumption patterns, dietary treatment compliance, and small intestinal digestive aberrations. Collectively, a parallelized dietary-bacterial-host MIM assessment functionally uncovers trans-kingdom interactomes shaping gastrointestinal ecology while offering personalized diagnostic and therapeutic insights into microbiome-associated disease."

Factors influencing these immune responses in children of different ages and tumor types are unknown. Novel immunotherapies can enhance anti-tumor immune responses, but few children have benefited, and markers of effective responses are lacking. Here, we present a systems-level analysis of immune responses in 191 children within a population-based cohort with diverse tumors and reveal that age and tumor type shape immune responses differently. Systemic inflammation and cytotoxic T cell responses correlate with tumor mutation rates and immune cell infiltration. Clonally expanded T cell responses are rarely detected in blood or tumors at diagnosis but are sometimes elicited during treatment. Expanded T cells are similarly regulated in children and adults with more immunogenic cancers. This research aims to facilitate the development of precision immunotherapies for children with cancer."

A biomarker correlating RNA mis-splicing, the core pathogenic disease mechanism, and muscle performance is crucial for assessing response to disease-modifying interventions. We evaluated the Myotonic Dystrophy Splice Index (SI), a composite RNA splicing biomarker incorporating 22 disease-specific events, as a potential biomarker of DM1 muscle weakness.\nMethods: Total RNA sequencing of tibialis anterior biopsies from 58 DM1 participants and 33 unaffected/disease controls was used to evaluate RNA splicing events across the disease spectrum. Targeted RNA sequencing was used to derive the SI from biopsies collected at baseline (n = 52) or a 3-month (n = 37) follow-up visit along with clinical measures of muscle performance.\nResults: The SI demonstrated significant associations with measures of muscle strength and ambulation, including ankle dorsiflexion strength (ADF) and 10-meter run/fast walk (Pearson r = -0.719 and -0.680, respectively). The SI was relatively stable over 3-months (ICC = 0.863). Latent-class analysis identified three DM1 subgroups stratified by baseline SI (SIMild, SIModerate, SISevere); SIModerate individuals had a significant increase in the SI over 3-months. Multiple linear regression modeling revealed that baseline ADF and SI were predictive of strength at 3-months (adjusted R² = 0.830).\nConclusion: The SI is a reliable biomarker that captures associations of RNA mis-splicing with physical strength and mobility and has prognostic utility to predict future function, establishing it as a potential biomarker for assessment of therapeutic target engagement.\nTrial registration: NCT03981575Funding: FDA (7R01FD006071), Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation, Wyck Foundation, Muscular Dystrophy Association, Novartis, Dyne, Avidity, PepGen, Takeda, Sanofi Genzyme, Pfizer, Arthex, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals."

The primary analyses were supported by corresponding per-protocol analyses.\nConclusions and relevance: The results of this cohort study suggest that people with type 2 diabetes who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin had comparable long-term kidney outcomes."

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are susceptible to replication stress, which is a major contributor to HSC defects in Fanconi anemia (FA). Here, we report that HSCs relax the global chromatin by downregulating the expression of a chromatin architectural protein, DEK, in response to replication stress. DEK is abnormally accumulated in bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells from patients with FA and in Fancd2-deficient HSCs. DEK haploinsufficiency promotes chromatin relaxation, replication stress relief, and function recovery of Fancd2-deficient HSCs. Furthermore, inhibition of DEK restores the proliferation of FA CD34+ cells in vitro and enhances their engraftment in vivo. Mechanistically, the activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), specifically phosphorylated ATF2 at Thr69/71, was identified as a promoter of DEK transcription. Fancd2 deficiency results in p38 hyperphosphorylation, which in turn phosphorylates ATF2 at Thr69/71, leading to DEK accumulation in HSCs. In conclusion, our findings establish a functional link between chromatin relaxation and replication stress tolerance in HSCs and highlight DEK as a target for FA."

    "abstract": "Background: Overweight and obesity pose serious health challenges for individuals and societies. This study aims to facilitate personalised treatment of obesity by summarising recent research on weight-loss pharmacotherapies, with a focus on their effects on weight reduction, cardiometabolic health, psychological outcomes, and adverse events.\nMethods: This systematic review and meta-analysis included searches of Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to June 8, 2024. Randomised controlled trials evaluating weight-loss pharmacotherapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) for treating overweight or obesity were included. Primary outcomes included changes in body weight, cardiometabolic indicators, psychological outcomes, and adverse events. Summary data was extracted from published reports. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate weighted mean differences (WMDs), risk ratios (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the certainty of evidence for each pooled analysis. PROSPERO registration: CRD42024547905.\nFindings: A total of 154 randomised controlled trials (n = 112,515 participants) were included. Tirzepatide had the greatest weight-loss effect (WMD -11.69, 95% CI -19.22 to -4.15; P = 0.0024; I2 = 100.0%; moderate certainty), followed by semaglutide (-8.48, -12.68 to -4.27; P < 0.0001; I2 = 100.0%; moderate certainty). Tirzepatide had the strongest antihypertensive effect on both systolic (WMD -5.74, -9.00 to -2.48; P = 0.0006; I2 = 99.8%; moderate certainty) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD -2.91, -4.97 to -0.85; P = 0.0056; I2 = 99.8%; moderate certainty) and best reduced triglycerides (WMD -0.77, -0.85 to -0.69; P < 0.0001; I2 = 3.2%; high certainty), fasting glucose (WMD -3.06, -5.53 to -0.59; P = 0.015; I2 = 100.0%; moderate certainty), insulin (WMD -4.91, -8.15 to -1.68; P = 0.0029; I2 = 97.0%; moderate certainty), and glycated haemoglobin levels (WMD -1.27, -1.82 to -0.73; P < 0.0001; I2 = 100.0%; moderate certainty). Semaglutide (RR 0.83, 0.74-0.92; P < 0.0001; I2 = 0.0%; high certainty) and liraglutide (0.87, 0.79-0.96; P = 0.0059; I2 = 0.0%; high certainty) reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). However, all three medications were associated with adverse gastrointestinal effects. Naltrexone/bupropion increased the risk of elevated blood pressure (RR 1.72, 1.04-2.85; P = 0.036; I2 = 0.0%; high certainty). Topiramate increased depression risk (RR 1.62, 1.14 to 2.30; P = 0.0077; I2 = 0.0%; high certainty), and phentermine/topiramate raised concerns about anxiety (RR 1.91, 1.09 to 3.35; P = 0.025; I2 = 29.5%; high certainty), sleep disorders (RR 1.55, 1.24-1.93; P < 0.0001; I2 = 0.0%; high certainty), and irritability (RR 3.31, 1.69-6.47; P < 0.0001; I2 = 0.0%; high certainty). No medication increased the risk of serious adverse events.\nInterpretation: For weight reduction, tirzepatide is the top choice, followed by semaglutide. Considering cardiometabolic risk factors, tirzepatide shows the best blood pressure- and glucose-lowering benefits, while semaglutide and liraglutide reduce the risk of MACEs. Naltrexone/bupropion carries a risk of increased blood pressure. Phentermine/topiramate should be used with caution due to its higher risk of psychological side effects. Despite limitations related to study heterogeneity, these findings provide valuable insights for weight management strategies across diverse individuals.\nFunding: National Natural Science Foundation of China, Leading Talents Program of Hunan Province, and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University."

    "abstract": "Background: Numerous meta-analyses have identified various risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), prompting a comprehensive study to synthesize evidence quality and strength.\nMethods: This umbrella review of meta-analyses was conducted throughout PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Evidence strength was evaluated according to the evidence categories criteria.\nResults: We identified 101 risk factors throughout 175 meta-analyses. 31 risk factors were classified as evidence levels of class I, II, or III. HBV and HCV infections increase HCC risk by 12.5-fold and 11.2-fold, respectively. These risks are moderated by antiviral treatments and virological responses but are exacerbated by higher HBsAg levels, anti-HBc positivity, and co-infection. Smoking, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes, low platelet, elevated liver enzymes and liver fluke infection increase HCC risk, while coffee consumption, a healthy diet, and bariatric surgery lower it. Medications like metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), aspirin, statins, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors reduce HCC risk, while acid suppressive agents, particularly proton pump inhibitors, elevate it. Blood type O reduces the risk of HCC, while male gender and older age increase the risk.\nConclusions: HBV and HCV are major HCC risk factors, with risk mitigation through antiviral treatments. Lifestyle habits such as smoking and alcohol use significantly increase HCC risk, highlighting the importance of cessation. Certain drugs like aspirin, statins, GLP-1 RAs, and metformin may reduce HCC occurrence, but further research is needed to confirm these effects."

In this study, we evaluated safety outcomes in 783 patients over more than 2,200 total patient-years of observation from 38 T cell therapy trials. The trials employed integrating gammaretroviral or lentiviral vectors to deliver engineered receptors to target HIV-1 infection or cancer. Eighteen patients (2.3%) developed secondary malignancies after treatment, with a median onset of 1.94 years (range: 51 d to 14 years). Where possible, incident tumor samples were analyzed for vector copy number, revealing no evidence of high-level marking or other indications of insertional mutagenesis. One T cell lymphoma was detected, but malignant T cells were not marked by vector integration. Analysis of vector integration sites in 176 patients revealed no pathological insertions linked to secondary malignancies, although, in some cases, integration in or near specific genes, including tumor suppressor genes, was associated with modest clonal expansion and sustained T cell persistence. These findings highlight the safety of engineered T cell therapies."

However, their effectiveness and risks have not yet been systematically evaluated in a comprehensive set of possible health outcomes. Here, we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs databases to build a cohort of people with diabetes who initiated GLP-1RA (n = 215,970) and compared them to those who initiated sulfonylureas (n = 159,465), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors (n = 117,989) or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (n = 258,614), a control group composed of an equal proportion of individuals initiating sulfonylureas, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors (n = 536,068), and a control group of 1,203,097 individuals who continued use of non-GLP-1RA antihyperglycemics (usual care). We used a discovery approach to systematically map an atlas of the associations of GLP-1RA use versus each comparator with 175 health outcomes. Compared to usual care, GLP-1RA use was associated with a reduced risk of substance use and psychotic disorders, seizures, neurocognitive disorders (including Alzheimer's disease and dementia), coagulation disorders, cardiometabolic disorders, infectious illnesses and several respiratory conditions. There was an increased risk of gastrointestinal disorders, hypotension, syncope, arthritic disorders, nephrolithiasis, interstitial nephritis and drug-induced pancreatitis associated with GLP-1RA use compared to usual care. The results provide insights into the benefits and risks of GLP-1RAs and may be useful for informing clinical care and guiding research agendas."

    "abstract": "S-palmitoylation is a reversible and widespread post-translational modification, but its role in the regulation of ferroptosis has been poorly understood. Here, we elucidate that GPX4, an essential regulator of ferroptosis, is reversibly palmitoylated on cysteine 66. The acyltransferase ZDHHC20 palmitoylates GPX4 and increases its protein stability. ZDHHC20 depletion or inhibition of protein palmitoylation by 2-BP sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis. Moreover, we identify APT2 as the depalmitoylase of GPX4. Genetic silencing or pharmacological inhibition of APT2 with ML349 increases GPX4 palmitoylation, thereby stabilizing the protein and conferring resistance to ferroptosis. Notably, disrupting GPX4 palmitoylation markedly potentiates ferroptosis in xenografted and orthotopically implanted tumor models, and inhibits tumor metastasis through blood vessels. In the chemically induced colorectal cancer model, knockout of APT2 significantly aggravates cancer progression. Furthermore, pharmacologically modulating GPX4 palmitoylation impacts liver ischemia-reperfusion injury. Overall, our findings uncover the intricate network regulating GPX4 palmitoylation, highlighting its pivotal role in modulating ferroptosis sensitivity."

    "abstract": "Hypusination of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) is essential for its role in translation elongation and termination. Although the function of hypusinated eIF5A (eIF5AHyp) in cellular proliferation is well-characterized, the role of its unhypusinated form (eIF5ALys) remains unclear. We hypothesized that eIF5ALys exerts independent, negative effects on cellular replication and metabolism, distinct from the loss of eIF5AHyp. To test this hypothesis, we utilized zebrafish and mouse models with inducible knockdowns of deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and eIF5A to investigate their roles in cellular growth. Gene expression analysis via RNA sequencing and morphometric measurements of pancreas and β-cell mass were performed to assess phenotypic changes and identify affected biological pathways. Loss of DHPS in zebrafish resulted in significant defects in pancreatic growth, accompanied by changes in gene expression related to mRNA translation, neurogenesis, and stress pathways. By contrast, knockdown of eIF5A had minimal impact on pancreas development, suggesting that the effects of DHPS loss are not solely due to the lack of eIF5AHyp. In mice, β cell-specific deletion of DHPS impaired β cell mass expansion and glucose tolerance, while eIF5A deletion had no statistically significant effects. These findings provide evidence for an independent role for eIF5ALys in regulating developmental and functional responses in pancreas health and disease."

    "abstract": "Background: As an emerging concept, Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome (CKM) elucidates the intricate interconnection between metabolic disorders(Mets), cardiovascular disease(CVD), and chronic kidney disease(CKD). Within this context, while numerous studies have demonstrated a correlation between the Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) and CVD, the precise relationship between long-term fluctuations in the AIP and the incidence of CVD in patients with CKM syndrome remains unclear.\nMethod: The CKM stages 0-3 population was obtained from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The outcome CVD was defined as self-reported heart disease and/or stroke. AIP control level was classified using k-mean cluster analysis. Logistic regression was used to analyse the effect of cumulative AIP (cumAIP) on the incidence of CVD. Restricted cubic spline models (RCS) were used to explore the potential non-linear relationship between cumulative AIP and CVD risk at different CKM syndrome stages.\nResults: Of the 3429 CKM stages 0-3 participants, 620 patients developed CVD during the 3-year follow-up period. After adjusting for various confounders, the odds ratio (OR) for the well-controlled class 2 compared with the best AIP control class 1 were 1.37 (1.04, 1.81), the OR for the moderately-controlled class 3 were 1.54 (95% CI, 1.04-2.26), the poorly-controlled class 4 were 1.65 (95% CI, 1.13-2.41), and the worst-controlled class 5 were 2.14 (95% CI, 1.15-3.97). In restricted cubic spline regression analyses, changes in AIP were linearly associated with the occurrence of CVD events. Further weighted quartiles and regression analyses indicated that triglyceride(TG) was a key variable for AIP in predicting CVD events in the CKM stages 0-3 population.\nConclusions: Poor control level of AIP are associated with an increased risk of CVD events in the population of CKM stages 0-3. Long-term dynamic monitoring of changes in AIP may help in the early identification of patients at high risk of developing CVD in the individuals with CKM stages 0-3."

    "abstract": "The marking of DNA, histones, and RNA is central to gene expression regulation in development and disease. Recent evidence links N6-methyladenosine (m6A), installed on RNA by the METTL3-METTL14 methyltransferase complex, to histone modifications, but the link between m6A and DNA methylation remains scarcely explored. This study shows that METTL3-METTL14 recruits the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 to chromatin for gene-body methylation. We identify a set of genes whose expression is fine-tuned by both gene-body 5mC, which promotes transcription, and m6A, which destabilizes transcripts. We demonstrate that METTL3-METTL14-dependent 5mC and m6A are both essential for the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into embryoid bodies and that the upregulation of key differentiation genes during early differentiation depends on the dynamic balance between increased 5mC and decreased m6A. Our findings add a surprising dimension to our understanding of how epigenetics and epitranscriptomics combine to regulate gene expression and impact development and likely other biological processes."

To unlock the potential of EHR data to improve patient health, public health, and health care, it is essential to streamline the exchange of health data. As leaders across the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), we describe how DHHS has implemented fundamental building blocks to achieve this vision.\nObservations: Across DHHS, we have implemented 3 foundational building blocks called for by the 2016 21st Century Cures Act to create a unified approach for secure, high-quality, and timely exchange of health data across the health care system. The United States Core Data for Interoperability provides a minimum baseline for data elements that must be available in federally regulated health information technology systems such as certified EHRs. These data elements now must be accessible using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources-a secure, flexible, and open-industry standard for health data exchange. The Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement provides a network to securely exchange health data across the country. The 3 building blocks of United States Core Data for Interoperability, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, and Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement are now in place thanks to diligent public and private sector work over 2 administrations. Across DHHS, we are working to refine these building blocks and increase their adoption through regulatory authorities, grants, and public-private partnerships.\nConclusions and relevance: The technological building blocks described in this article are creating a unified approach to health data exchange for patient access, clinical care, quality improvement, scientific research, public health, and other uses of health data. Collaborations between the public, nonprofit, and private sectors are needed to maximize their potential. By unlocking the potential of health data, these building blocks are the foundation of a 21st-century digital health care system that will improve the experience of patients and clinicians and result in better health outcomes."

The purpose of this scoping review was to examine and synthesize the existing literature surrounding transition experiences for culturally Deaf and deaf and hard of hearing populations through the lens of Meleis' Transitions Theory.\nMethod: Using PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a scoping review of literature related to transition experiences for culturally Deaf individuals and individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing was conducted. The scope of the review was limited to articles focused on the United States and Canada published in the past ten years.\nResults: After the screening process, 46 sources related to transition experiences remained. The following transition periods were identified: postsecondary education transitions, early childhood transitions, other education transitions, vocational transitions, social transitions, independent living transitions, and health-related transitions. Additional concepts from Meleis' Transitions Theory, such as transition types and transition conditions, were identified and included in the thematic analysis.\nDiscussion: Existing literature primarily focused on educational and vocational transitions during adolescence and young adulthood. However, most quantitative studies were secondary analyses of the National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS2).

A divergent synthesis with an Ireland-Claisen rearrangement as the key step allowed access to numerous compounds, some of which we crystallized in the active site of arginase 2. We subsequently used structure-based drug design to further improve the potency of this series, ultimately achieving an inhibitor with an IC50 value of 12 nM. Many compounds in this series were designed to behave as prodrugs, releasing their payload with up to 4-fold improved oral exposure relative to the parent.

We found that Arabidopsis double knockout mutant gdh1gdh2 for genes of NAD(H)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase retains green color of the leaves (stay-green phenotype) during a dark-induced senescence, in contrast to wild-type plants, whose leaves turn yellow. When the gdh1gdh2 plants are exposed to the dark more than four days, they demonstrate slower chlorophyll degradation than in the wild-type plants under the same conditions, as well as dysregulation of chlorophyll breakdown genes encoding chlorophyll b reductase, Mg-dechelatase, pheophytinase and pheophorbide a oxygenase. The slowed degradation of chlorophyll b in gdh1gdh2 plants significantly alters the chlorophyll a/b ratio. Ion leakage in the mutant plants increases significantly from four to eight days in the darkness, correlating with their premature death during this period. The discovered facts suggest a functional connection between activity of NAD(H)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase and dark-induced senescence progress in Arabidopsis."

    "abstract": "Transformed lung organoids have extensive applications in lung cancer modeling and drug screening. Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures fail to propagate a large subpopulation of murine primary tumors in vitro. However, three-dimensional (3D) air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures, which are employed to grow normal lung organoids, can be used to efficiently culture cancerous lung tumor cells. Here, we detail a procedure for cultivating genetically modified lung organoids in 3D-ALI cultures. This protocol contains two parts. The first part describes how to transduce lung epithelial cells, which are either freshly sorted from lungs or from actively growing murine organoids, with virus in order to modify gene expression. The target lung cells are incubated with virus for 1-2 h for transduction. Then, the transduced cells are thoroughly washed and mixed with stromal support cells and Matrigel and are loaded into transwell inserts for culture and validated for genetic modifications through downstream assays. The second part describes how to isolate tumor cells growing orthotopically in genetically engineered mouse models to produce organoid cell lines that can be used for ex vivo drug discovery assays. For this protocol, tumors are isolated from lungs of mice, finely chopped and washed. Then, tumor chunks are mixed with Matrigel for 3D-ALI culture. Finally, organoids budding from tumor chunks are trypsinized and passaged to establish an organoid line. Together these two protocols provide a promising platform to study the genesis, progression, and treatment of lung cancer."

However, the optimal monitor positioning to avoid interference with surgical manipulation remains unresolved. Herein, the authors describe two cases in which a three-dimensional head-mounted display (3D-HMD) was introduced into a transcranial neurosurgical procedure using an exoscope.\nObservations: Case 1 was a 50-year-old man who presented with recurrent epistaxis and was diagnosed with an olfactory neuroblastoma that extended from the nasal cavity to the anterior cranial base and infiltrated the right anterior cranial fossa. Case 2 was a 65-year-old man who presented with epistaxis and was diagnosed with a left-sided olfactory neuroblastoma. In both cases, en bloc tumor resection was successfully performed via a simultaneous exoscopic transcranial approach using a 3D-HMD and an endoscopic endonasal approach, eliminating the need to watch a large monitor beside the patient.\nLessons: This is the first report of using a 3D-HMD in transcranial surgery. The 3D-HMD effectively addressed issues with the field of vision and concentration while preserving the effectiveness of traditional microscopic and exoscopic procedures when observed on a 3D monitor. Combining the 3D-HMD with an exoscope holds the potential to become a next-generation surgical approach."

    "abstract": "Objective: To assess the safety, immunogenicity and cellular responses following the Moderna Spikevax primary series in rheumatic disease.\nMethods: We conducted a 12-month, prospective, non-randomised, open-label, comparative trial of adults with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=131) on stable treatment; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n=23) on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF); other rheumatic diseases on prednisone ≥10 mg/day (n=8) or age-matched/sex-matched controls (healthy control, HC, n=58). Adverse events (AEs), humoral immune responses (immunogenicity: IgG positivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its receptor binding domain, neutralising antibodies (NAbs)), cellular responses (ELISpot) and COVID-19 infection rates were assessed.\nResults: Frequency of solicited self-reported AEs following vaccination was similar across groups (HC 90%, RA 86%, SLE 90%); among them, musculoskeletal AEs were more frequent in RA (HC 48% vs RA 66% (Δ95% CI CI 3 to 32.6)). Disease activity scores did not increase postvaccination. No vaccine-related serious AEs were reported. Postvaccination immunogenicity was reduced in RA and SLE (RA 90.2%, SLE 86.4%; for both, ΔCIs compared with HC excluded the null). Similarly, NAbs were reduced among patients (RA 82.6%, SLE 81.8%). In RA, age >65 (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.8) and rituximab treatment (OR 0.003, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.02) were negative predictors of immunogenicity. ELISpot was positive in 16/52 tested RA and 17/26 HC (ΔCI 11.2-53.3). During the study, 11 HC, 19 RA and 3 SLE patients self-reported COVID-infection.\nConclusion: In COVID-19 Vaccine in Immunosuppressed Adults with Autoimmune Diseases, the Moderna Spikevax primary series was safe. MMF, RA age >65 and rituximab were associated with reduced vaccine-induced protection."

    "abstract": "Study objective: The standard of care for detecting acute kidney injury (AKI) is change in serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output, which are limited. This study aimed to compare urinary biomarkers neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) with kidney injury molecule-1 (uKIM-1) in critically ill children exposed to vancomycin who did and did not develop AKI as defined by changes in SCr.\nDesign: Single-center, prospective, clinical, observational cohort study.\nSetting: Tertiary care children's hospital in an urban setting.\nPatients: Children aged 0 (corrected gestational age 42 weeks) to 18 years admitted to the intensive care unit who received vancomycin were included.\nIntervention: None.\nMeasurements: The primary outcome was mean change in uNGAL and uKIM-1 between AKI and no-AKI groups. AKI was defined as a minimum 50% increase in SCr from baseline over a 48 h period, within 7 days of first vancomycin exposure. Three urine samples were collected: baseline (between 0 and 6 h of first vancomycin dose), second (18-24 h after the \"baseline\"), and third (18-24 h after the second sample). Concentrations of uKIM-1 and uNGAL were measured in each sample.\nMain results: Forty-eight children (52% male; median age 6 years) were included. Eight (16.7%) children developed AKI. Mean changes in uNGAL (713.196 ± 1,216,474 vs. 16.101 ± 37.812 pg/mL; p = 0.0004) and uKIM-1 (6060 ± 11.165 vs. 340 ± 542 pg/mL; p = 0.0015) were greater in children with AKI versus no-AKI, respectively.\nConclusions: uNGAL and uKIM-1 concentrations increased significantly more in critically ill children with AKI compared with those with no-AKI during the first 48-72 h of vancomycin exposure and may be useful as prospective biomarkers of AKI."

    "abstract": "A freshwater photosynthetic arsenite-oxidizing bacterium, Cereibacter azotoformans strain ORIO, was isolated from Owens River, CA, USA. The waters from Owens River are elevated in arsenic and serve as the headwaters to the Los Angeles Aqueduct. The complete genome sequence of strain ORIO is 4.8 Mb genome (68% G + C content) and comprises two chromosomes and six plasmids. Taxonomic analysis placed ORIO within the Cereibacter genus (formerly Rhodobacter). The ORIO genome contains arxB2 AB1 CD (encoding an arsenite oxidase), arxXSR (regulators) and several ars arsenic resistance genes all co-localised on a 136 kb plasmid, named pORIO3. Phylogenetic analysis of ArxA, the molybdenum-containing arsenite oxidase catalytic subunit, demonstrated photoarsenotrophy is likely to occur within members of the Alphaproteobacteria. ORIO is a mixotroph, oxidises arsenite to arsenate (As(V)) photoheterotrophically, and expresses arxA in cultures grown with arsenite. Further ecophysiology studies with Owens River sediment demonstrated the interconversion of arsenite and As(V) was dependent on light-dark cycling. arxA and arrA (As(V) respiratory reductase) genes were detected in the light-dark cycled sediment metagenomes suggesting syntrophic interactions among arsenotrophs. This work establishes C. azotoformans str. ORIO as a new model organism for studying photoarsenotrophy and light-dark arsenic biogeochemical cycling."

    "abstract": "Studies of the past 15 years have revealed a critical role for extracellular heat shock protein 90alpha (eHsp90α) in the development of several human disorders, including wound healing, cachexia (muscle wasting), inflammatory diseases, and cancers. The two established functions of highly purified eHsp90α protein are to promote cell survival and to stimulate cell migration. However, the mechanism of secretion and the method of isolation of eHsp90α remained to be standardized. Among the half a dozen reported methodologies, differential centrifugation is considered the \"gold standard\" largely for its quantitative recovery of eHsp90α from a conditioned medium of cultured cells. Herein, we describe a revised protocol that isolates three fractions of extracellular vesicles with distinct ranges of diameters and the leftover vesicle-free supernatant for biochemical analyses, especially eHsp90α, from tumor cell-conditioned media. Quantitation of the relative amount of eHsp90α can be carried out with known amounts of recombinant Hsp90α protein on the same SDS-PAGE. We believe that this modified methodology will prove to be a useful tool for studying eHsp90α in cultured cells and beyond."

In particular, adequate selenium levels lead to a better antioxidant and immune response. The aim of this work is to assess whether blood selenium levels, at time of SARS-CoV-2 infection, have an impact on the development and severity of COVID-19. A systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative and descriptive studies using MeSH terms, selenium and COVID-19 was performed. We searched bibliographic databases up to 17 July 2022 in PubMed and ScienceDirect. Studies that reported data on blood selenium levels were considered. A total of 629 articles were examined by abstract and title, of which 595 abstracts were read, of which 38 were included in the systematic review and 11 in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was conducted to mean difference (MD) with a 95 % confidence interval (CI), and heterogeneity was tested by I2 with random factors with a MD between selenium levels, mortality, morbidity and healthy subjects with a P-value of 0⋅05. Selenium levels were higher in healthy people compared to those in patients with COVID-19 disease (six studies, random effects MD: test for overall effect Z = 3⋅28 (P = 0⋅001), 97 % CI 28⋅36 (11⋅41-45⋅31), P < 0⋅00001), but without difference when compared with the degree of severity in mild, moderate or severe cases. In conclusion, the patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection had lower selenium levels than the healthy population. More studies are needed to evaluate its impact on clinical severity through randomised clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Background: Interferon beta therapies are well-established disease-modifying treatments for patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Based on clinical evidence from two large cohort studies, both, the EMA and FDA updated the labels of the interferon beta class in terms of pregnancy and breastfeeding in 2019 and 2020, respectively. To complement pregnancy label updates with patient-reported real-world data, this study examined German pregnancy and outcome reports including available data on child development from women with MS treated with peginterferon beta-1a or intramuscular (IM) interferon beta-1a.\nMethods: The post-authorisation safety study PRIMA included adult women diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS or clinically isolated syndrome, who were treated with peginterferon beta-1a or IM interferon beta-1a before or during pregnancy and registered in the marketing authorisation holder's MS Service center patient support program. In the prospective part of the study, conducted from April to October 2021, data on developmental milestones of the newborns were collected via telephone interview from mothers reporting live births.\nResults: In total, 426 women were enrolled, reporting 542 pregnancies that resulted in 466 live births. A total of 162 women completed the questionnaire for 192 live births (53.1% male). Newborns had Apgar scores indicative of healthy infants. Weight, length and head circumference at birth and physical growth curves up to 48 months lay within the expected range of the German general population. Most newborn screenings and examinations during check-ups were inconspicuous over the study period of 48 months. Out of 158 breastfed infants, 112 (70.9%) were breastfed exclusively until month 5.\nConclusion: Study results confirmed former reports indicating that exposure to interferon beta therapies during pregnancy or lactation had no adverse effects on intrauterine growth and child development over the study period, which covered the first 4 years of life. These real-world data obtained within the scope of a patient support program for peginterferon beta-1a or IM interferon beta-1a corroborate German and Scandinavian registry data and support the label update of all interferon beta therapies.\nRegistration: NCT04655222, EUPAS38347."

There is now an emerging evidence base suggesting that a subgroup of metastatic patients benefit significantly from local resection (surgery) or ablation (stereotactic ablative body radiation, SABR) of their metastatic sites. These patients are in what has been termed the 'oligometastatic state', a transitional window between local and disseminated disease where locally ablative, metastasis-directed therapy prolongs progression-free survival, improves overall survival and sometimes achieves cure. Appropriately selecting those who fit this oligometastatic phenotype, while integrating advances in ablative technologies such as SABR with modern systemic treatments, is an evolving challenge for oncologists."

    "abstract": "Background: Despite the most recent American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline making a \"strong\" recommendation against the use of intraoperative navigation in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), its use is increasing. We utilized the concept of the reverse fragility index (RFI) to assess the strength of neutrality of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the long-term survivorship of computer-navigated and conventional TKA.\nMethods: A systematic review was performed including all RCTs through August 3, 2021, comparing the long-term outcomes of computer-navigated and conventional TKA. Randomized trials with mean follow-up of >8 years and survivorship with revision as the end point were included. The RFI quantifies the strength of a study's neutrality by calculating the minimum number of events necessary to flip the result from nonsignificant to significant. The RFI at a threshold of p < 0.05 was calculated for each study reporting nonsignificant results. The reverse fragility quotient (RFQ) was calculated by dividing the RFI by the study sample size.\nResults: Ten clinical trials with 2,518 patients and 38 all-cause revisions were analyzed. All 10 studies reported nonsignificant results. The median RFI at the p < 0.05 threshold was 4, meaning that a median of 4 events would be needed to change the results from nonsignificant to significant. The median RFQ was 0.029, indicating that the nonsignificance of the results was contingent on only 2.9 events per 100 participants. The median loss to follow-up was 27 patients. In all studies, the number of patients lost to follow-up was greater than the RFI.\nConclusions: The equipoise in long-term survivorship between computer-navigated and conventional TKA rests on fragile studies, as their statistical nonsignificance could be reversed by changing the outcome status of only a handful of patients--a number that was always smaller than the number lost to follow-up. Routine reporting of the RFI in trials with nonsignificant findings may provide readers with a measure of confidence in the neutrality of the results.\nLevel of evidence: Prognostic Level II.

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of morbid obesity on in-hospital mortality, total hospital costs and discover the prevalence of morbid obesity among inpatients with T(A)AD.\nMethods: Patients with a primary diagnosis of T(A)AD were identified from the National Inpatient Sample database (NIS) from 2008 to 2017. These patients were categorized into non-obesity, obesity and morbid obesity. Multivariable regression models were utilized to assess the association between obesity/morbid obesity and in-hospital mortality, total cost and other clinical factors. The temporal trend in prevalence of obesity/morbid obesity in T(A)ADs and the trend of in-hospital mortality among different weight categories were also explored.\nResults: From the NIS database 8489 T(A)AD inpatients were identified, of which 7230 (85.2%) patients were non-obese, 822 (9.7%) were obese and 437 (5.1%) were morbid obese. Morbid obesity was associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.86), 8% higher total cost compared with the non-obese patients. From 2008 to 2017, the rate of obesity and morbid obesity in patients with T(A)AD have significantly increased from 7.36 to 11.33% (P < 0.001) and from 1.95 to 7.37% (P < 0.001). Factors associated with morbid obesity in T(A)ADs included age, female, elective admission, hospital region, dyslipidemia, smoking, rheumatoid arthritis/collagen vascular diseases, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes and hypertension.\nConclusions: Morbid obesity are connected with worse clinical outcomes and more health resource utilization in T(A)AD patients. Appropriate medical resource orientation and weight management education for T(A)AD patients may be necessary."

One baseline and four assessment meals were conducted across four textures of foods to investigate the presence or absence of components of chewing (bite down, chew and tongue lateralization), as well as movements associated with the development of chewing. Results showed that at baseline all participants ate their typical diet (i.e., pureed food) but no chewing components or movements were observed. The findings of the assessment protocol indicated that it offers a prescriptive assessment of chewing and its components across different food textures. The results of the assessment provided useful information for clinicians by identifying a potential starting point for interventions to address chewing deficits. Furthermore, the findings add to the existing literature on the role of tongue lateralization and specific tongue movements in chewing. Implications of the findings for chewing interventions and future research are discussed."

Observing the students' understanding could help educational efforts to be more student oriented. The aim was to evaluate dental and dental hygienist students' knowledge and attitudes on pain prevention and pain management in children and adolescents, applying a multidimensional questionnaire previously used on general dental practitioners.\nMaterials and methods: Three hundred and four dental and dental hygienist students at Swedish universities were eligible for the survey. Written and oral information was given about the study's aim, methods, anonymity and voluntary participation. The multidimensional questionnaire included 47 closed questions.\nResults: The total responding rate was 65.4%; dental students 61.1% and dental hygienist students 92.8%. The total mean of knowledge and attitudes, beneficial for the treating of patient pain, varied between 57.1% and 83.3%. The biggest knowledge gap was identified regarding the items: Children under 2 years of age experience less pain than children over 2 years undergoing similar treatment(34.3%), The dentist is better suited than the parent to judge if a child is in pain (29.4%), and usually the child's pain experience diminishes when the parents are present (24.2%).\nConclusion: Dental and dental hygienist students reported vastly spread knowledge and attitudes regarding pain prophylactic and pain management in children and adolescents, as measured by a multidimensional questionnaire previously used on GDPs. Knowledge on students' understanding of the young patient's pain could help educational efforts to be more student oriented.

In 4 of the 6 subjects, these sites were localized to the pars opercularis. Sentence comprehension was also disrupted by stimulation of other perisylvian sites, but in a more variable manner.\nConclusions: These findings suggest that there may be language regions that differentially contribute to sentence processing and which therefore are best identified using sentence-level tasks.

Dermal fibroblasts likely play an important role. The authors investigate the cellular-molecular features distinguishing fibroblasts from human striae distensae and normal skin. The authors also develop a mouse model of striae distensae.\nMethods: Human striae distensae and normal skin samples were compared for tensile strength and histologic structure. Fibroblasts from striae distensae and normal skin were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for gene expression analysis. Immunofluorescence staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting were used to confirm gene expression data at the protein level. A mouse model of striae distensae formation was created by administering corticosteroids and mechanically loading the dorsal skin.\nResults: Human striae distensae exhibited reduced tensile strength, more disordered collagen fibers, and epidermal atrophy compared to human normal skin. There were 296 up-regulated genes in striae distensae fibroblasts, including the profibrotic lineage and surface marker CD26. Up-regulated genes were involved in profibrotic and mechanoresponsive signaling pathways (TGFβ and FAK-PI3-AKT-signaling). In contrast, 571 genes were down-regulated, including CD74 and genes of the AMPK pathway. Increased CD26 and decreased CD74 expression was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunofluorescence. Similar cutaneous histologic and gene expression changes were induced in hypercortisolemic mice by mechanically loading the dorsal skin.\nConclusions: Fibroblasts from human striae distensae exhibit increased profibrotic and decreased antifibrotic signaling. CD26 and CD74 are promising surface markers that may be targeted therapeutically. The authors' mouse model of striae distensae can be used as a platform to test the efficacy of potential therapeutic agents.\nClinical relevance statement: Striae distensae are common disfiguring cutaneous lesions whose etiology remains elusive, which has hindered development of effective treatment strategies. Dermal fibroblasts likely play an important role. The authors sought to elucidate the key cellular-molecular pathways distinguishing fibroblasts in striae distensae from those in normal skin."

For case distribution and sources, the available records from the behavior service (n = 1923) from 1997 to 2017 were evaluated. Breeds of dogs presenting to all services (n = 51,052) were compared to behavior cases (n = 822) from 2007 to 2016. Over twenty years, 72.2% of dogs presented for aggression, 20.1% for anxieties/fears/phobias, and 7.4% for miscellaneous behavioral problems. Dogs acquired from breeders decreased and dogs from shelters, rescues, or adopted as a stray increased over twenty years (p < 0.0001). The Herding (p = 0.0124) and Terrier (p < 0.0001) groups were overrepresented for behavior problems as compared to all other services over ten years. Variations in terminology and diagnostic approach made comparisons with earlier studies difficult, which underscores a need for a more consistent methodology in veterinary behavioral medicine. Understanding trends in sources of dogs could direct resources aimed at guiding owners when acquiring a pet dog and preventing behavioral problems. Findings related to breeds could help guide research focused on the genetic contributions to behavior."

A total of 2145 microorganisms were identified, and the corresponding data were jointly analyzed by area, sampling period, and concentration.\nResults: The most frequently detected microorganisms in hospital air were Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Neisseria, and fungi, and the more polluted departments were the hemodialysis department, respiratory department, treatment room, and toilet. Significant differences were found between the concentration of bacteria and fungi before and during the pandemic, which could be related to multiple environmental conditions. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 was negative in all the air samples.\nConclusions: Overall, this study confirmed the existence and dynamic characteristics of airborne microorganisms in a hospital.

    "abstract": "Background: The nutritional rehabilitation of malnourished patients hospitalised with anorexia nervosa is essential. The provision of adequate nutrition must occur, while simultaneously, minimising the risk of refeeding complications, such as electrolyte, metabolic, and organ dysfunction. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of an iso-caloric lower carbohydrate/high fat enteral formula (28% carbohydrate, 56% fat) against a standard enteral formula (54% carbohydrate, 29% fat).\nMethods: Patients (aged 15-25 years) hospitalised with anorexia nervosa were recruited into this double blinded randomised controlled trial. An interim analysis was completed at midpoint, when 24 participants, mean age 17.5 years (± 1.1), had been randomly allocated to lower carbohydrate/high fat (n = 14) or standard (n = 10) feeds.\nResults: At baseline, there was no significant difference in degree of malnutrition, medical instability, history of purging or serum phosphate levels between the two treatment arms. A significantly lower rate of hypophosphatemia developed in patients who received the lower carbohydrate/high fat formula compared to standard formula (5/14 vs 9/10, p = 0.013). The serum phosphate level decreased in both feeds, however it decreased to a larger extent in the standard feed compared to the lower carbohydrate/high fat feed (standard feed 1.11 ± 0.13 mmol/L at baseline vs 0.88 ± 0.12 mmol/L at week 1; lower carbohydrate/high fat feed 1.18 ± 0.19 mmol/L at baseline vs 1.06 ± 0.15 mmol/L at week 1). Overall, serum phosphate levels were significantly higher in the lower carbohydrate/high fat feed compared with standard feed treatment arm at Week 1 (1.06 ± 0.15 mmol/L vs 0.88 ± 0.12 mmol/L, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in weight gain, number of days to reach medical stability, incidence of hypoglycaemia, or hospital length of stay.\nConclusions: The results of this study indicate that enteral nutrition provided to hospitalised malnourished young people with anorexia nervosa using a lower carbohydrate/high fat formula (28% carbohydrate, 56% fat) seems to provide protection from hypophosphatemia in the first week compared to when using a standard enteral formula.

Meta-analysis of the quantitative data (six studies) showed pooled prevalence of vitamin D deficiency as 45.91% (95% CI: 25.148-67.450). In infected pediatric patients, low levels of vitamin D increased the risk of severe disease (odds ratio-5.5; 95% CI: 1.560-19.515; P = 0.008). It was also found that children and adolescents having vitamin D deficiency had greater risk of COVID infection as compared to patients with normal vitamin D levels. Improvement in disease severity with vitamin D supplementation was also noted. The systematic review showed that almost half of the pediatric COVID patients suffer from vitamin D deficiency. It is also clear that the low level of vitamin D is associated with greater risk of infection and poorer outcome in pediatrics."

    "abstract": "Microbes mediate the arsenic detoxification in paddy soils, determining the fate of arsenic in soils and its availability to rice plants, yet little is known about the structures and abundances of functional genes as well as the driving forces in low-arsenic paddy fields. To depict the arsenic detoxification functional gene patterns, 429 soil samples were collected from 39 paddy fields across four climatic zones in China, with the arsenic contents ranged from 9.76 to 19.74 mg kg-1. GeoChip, a microarray-based metagenomic technique, was used to analyze the functional genes involved in arsenic detoxification. A total of three arsenic detoxification gene families were detected, aoxB, arxA (arsenite oxidase), and arsM (methyltransferase). Both the diversity and abundance of functional genes varied significantly among sampling sites (p < 0.05) and decreased along the arsenic gradient. Arsenic detoxification genes were carried by bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. Redundancy analysis showed that soil samples were grouped according to both climatic zones they located in and arsenic gradients at the continental scale. Soil pH, average annual temperature (AAT), arsenic, annual average precipitation (AAP), and CEC were the most important factors in shaping the functional structure. Structural equation modeling showed that AAT (r = 0.21), pH (r = -0.20), and arsenic contents (r = -0.11) directly affected the arsenic detoxification gene abundances. These findings provide an overall picture of microbial communities involved in arsenic detoxification in paddy soils and reveal the importance of climatic factors in shaping functional genes across a large spatial scale."

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is one of the most disastrous respiratory diseases (after the 1918 influenza outbreak) spreading in the community. So far, it has killed 7,37,417 individuals. High variability in the viral genome and its greater ability to spread in the human community are badly affecting the comorbid individuals. Although infected individuals mainly possess respiratory issues, neurological manifestations in these individuals cannot be overlooked. The literature search is based on the recent development in the concerned field. We searched databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect using the keywords \"COVID-19\", \"neurological manifestations\", \"CNS\", and \"PNS\". The major neurological complications observed in these patients are encephalitis, necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, Guillain-Barré Syndrome, smell/taste impairment, epileptic seizures, and abnormal states of consciousness. COVID-19 infection is just more than a cough, fever, and respiratory illness; it can cause indirect neurological complications in infected patients. It is therefore advised to treat and have a careful observation of the COVID-19 patients for neurological manifestations."

    "abstract": "The contamination of the aquatic environment by plastic nanoparticles is becoming a major concern due to their potential adverse effects in aquatic biota. Therefore, in-depth knowledge of their uptake, trafficking and effects at cellular and systemic levels is essential to understand their potential impacts for aquatic species. In this work, zebrafish (Danio rerio) was used as a model and our aims were: i) to determine the distribution, uptake, trafficking, degradation and genotoxicity of polystyrene (PS) NPs of different sizes in a zebrafish cell line; ii) to study PS NPs accumulation, migration of immune cells and genotoxicity in larvae exposed to PS NPs; and iii) to assess how PS NPs condition the survival of zebrafish larvae exposed to a pathogen and/or how they impact the resistance of an immunodeficient zebrafish. Our results revealed that the cellular distribution differed depending on the particle size: the 50 nm PS NPs were more homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm and the 1 μM PS NPs more agglomerated. The main endocytic mechanisms for the uptake of NPs were dynamin-dependent internalization for the 50 nm NPs and phagocytosis for the 1 μm nanoparticles. In both cases, degradation in lysosomes was the main fate of the PS NPs, which generated alkalinisation and modified cathepsin genes expression. These effects at cellular level agree with the results in vivo, since lysosomal alkalization increases oxidative stress and vice versa. Nanoparticles mainly accumulated in the gut, where they triggered reactive oxygen species, decreased expression of the antioxidant gene catalase and induced migration of immune cells. Finally, although PS NPs did not induce mortality in wild-type larvae, immunodeficient and infected larvae had decreased survival upon exposure to PS NPs. This fact could be explained by the mechanical disruption and/or the oxidative damage caused by these NPs that increase their susceptibility to pathogens."

    "abstract": "CsERF2, an ethylene response factor, plays a role in leaf variegation. Leaf variegation is a main ornamental characteristic in Cymbidium sinense (C. sinense). However, the mechanisms of leaf color variegation remain largely unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the cytological and physiological features, as well as molecular analyses of leaves from wild-type (WT) and leaf variegation mutants of Cymbidium sinense 'Dharma'. Chloroplasts with typical and functional structures were discovered in WT and green sectors of the mutants leaves (MG), but not in yellow sectors of the mutant leaves (MY). The activities of key enzymes involved in chlorophyll (Chl) degradation and their substrate contents were significantly increased in MY. Genes related to Chl degradation also showed a significant up-regulation in MY. Transcriptomic analysis showed that the expression of all identified ethylene response factors (ERFs) was significantly up-regulated, and the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) content in MY was significantly higher compared with MG. QRT-PCR analysis validated that the expression levels of genes related to Chl degradation could be positively affected by ethylene (ETH) treatment. Stable overexpression of CsERF2 in Nicotiana tabacum (N. tabacum) led to a decrease in Chl content and abnormal chloroplast. Transcriptomic analysis and qRT-PCR results showed that the KEGG pathway related to chloroplast development and function showed significant change in transgenic N. tabacum. Therefore, the leaf color formation of C. sinense was greatly affected by chloroplast development and Chl metabolism. CsERF2 played an important role in leaf variegation of C. sinense."

Yet, not only in adults, but also in childhood obesity negatively impacts knee structures.\nObjective: The current study therefore investigated the sex-specific growth of the IPFP with age and body weight in healthy children and adolescents.\nMaterials and methods: Thirty young healthy subjects (60% girls; age 4-17 years, body weight 14-90 kg in girls and 29-105 kg in boys; BMI 12.2-32.4 kg/m2) without magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) knee pathology were studied. The IPFP volume was determined from sagittal T-1 weighted and proton-density spectral attenuated inversion recovery MRIs. The primary analysis focused on the sex-specific IPFP volume/body weight ratio as dependent, and age as independent variable, using linear regression models. A secondary analytic focus was the slope of the age-dependence of IPFP volume, without normalization to body weight.\nResults: There was no statistically significant association of the IPFP volume/body weight ratio with age in girls (p = 0.57) or boys (p = 0.31), the R2 of ranging from -0.32 to 0.14. The ratio was greater in boys (0.54 ± 0.10 cm3/kg) than in girls (0.45 ± 0.07 cm3/kg) (p < 0.01). The IPFP volume increased by approx. 2 cm3 per annum in both girls and boys, without any indication of a non-linear relationship.\nConclusion: Our findings reveal that the ratio of the IPFP volume and body weight remains constant between age 4 and 17 in both normal weight girls and boys, and that the IPFP volume increases linearly with age throughout this period."

It is a psychological and behavioral syndrome described by three dimensions: emotional exhaustion (EE); depersonalization (DP); and low personal accomplishment (PA).\nObjectives: This study aims to calculate the prevalence of BS and its related risk factors among physicians of primary health care centers (PHCCs) of the Ministry of Health (MOH, Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia.\nMaterials and method: A cross-sectional study was conducted in which 280 physicians working in PHCCs were selected as a comprehensive sample, the response rate was 80.7%. We excluded the trainee of residency programs, interns, and hospital physicians providing partial service in PHCCs. The data was collected by using two-part self-administered questionnaire including sociodemographic data, working conditions, and Maslach Burnout Inventory™-Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel-MBI-HSS (MP). This data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) program.\nResults: The mean score for EE was 24.99 ± 11.54 SD. The mean score for DP was 9.19 ± 6.13 SD. For PA, it was 29.41 ± 9.9 SD. The percentage of participants who scored high in EE was 47.3%. About one-half of the participants scored high DP and 59.7% had diminished PA. About one-quarter of the participants (24.3%) scored high burnout in all three dimensions. High EE was present in ages from 35 to 45 years, Saudi participants, rotating or covering physicians, and participants who were satisfied with their job. High DP was seen in Saudi physicians, family physicians, rotating or covering physicians, those who were not satisfied with their job, and physicians who work in rural areas. Low PA was seen in physicians who were not satisfied with their job, rotating or covering physicians, participants who do not have tasks other than clinical work, and physicians who work in Omran sector.\nConclusion: There is a significant level of burnout among physicians working in PHCCs in Al Ahsa. High burnout was associated with some risk factors. Further research is needed to study this problem in depth."

    "abstract": "Traditionally, resting heart rate variability (rHRV) is measured for 10 min using the last 5 min for analyses (e.g., criterion period). It is unknown whether the measurement period can be shortened in pregnant women as there are currently no established standards. We aimed to compare shorter time segments (e.g., from the 1st to 10th minutes) of the parasympathetic index natural logarithm transformation of root mean square of successive R-R differences (Ln rMSSD) with the criterion period in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Twelve pregnant (age: 30.8 ± 3.4 years; gestational age: 20.1 ± 5.0 weeks) and 15 nonpregnant women (age: 29.8 ± 4.0 years) were included. rHRV was measured using a portable heart rate monitor for 10 min while sitting. Ln rMSSD difference/agreement between shorter time segments and criterion period was analyzed. The result observed between the 4th-5th minutes was the shortest time segment not different from/highly agreed with the criterion period in pregnant women (difference [95% confidence interval (CI)]: -0.10 [-0.22 to 0.02]/bias ± 1.96 × SD: -0.06 [-0.38 to 0.25]). In nonpregnant women, the 2nd-3rd-minute segment was the shortest with similar results (difference [95% CI]: -0.04 [-0.15 to 0.07]/bias ± 1.96 × SD: -0.03 [-0.39 to 0.32]). The Ln rMSSD was found to be stable from the 5th-10th minutes and the 3rd-10th minutes in pregnant and nonpregnant women, respectively. A shortened rHRV assessment can increase its applicability in clinical/exercise-training settings. Novelty Ln rMSSD can be measured for 5 min in pregnant women, with the last 1-min segment analyzed. The last 1-min segment from 3 min can be used for rHRV measurement in nonpregnant women. The shortened rHRV assessment can facilitate its applicability in clinical/exercise-training settings."

Challenging behaviors in clinical settings have been identified as a barrier to providing adequate care for this population.\nObjective: This scoping review examined the within-session effects of multisensory environments (MSEs) on people with IDD to determine the clinical utility of MSEs for this population.\nData sources: Studies published between January 1, 2000, and August 1, 2018, were identified using Summon and Google Scholar.\nStudy selection: Studies were included in the review if they systematically collected and reported data on within-session effects of an MSE intervention on people with IDD.\nFindings: Thirteen studies met criteria for this review: 4 with Level I evidence, 2 with Level II evidence, 3 with Level III evidence, and 4 with Level IV evidence. Studies examined the effects of MSEs on maladaptive behaviors, positive behaviors, distress and discomfort, activity and alertness states, and cost of care for people with IDD.\nConclusion and relevance: Preliminary support was found for the use of MSEs in clinical settings to reduce anxiety and challenging behaviors in patients with IDD during clinical care. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of MSEs for producing the effects described in this review.\nWhat this article adds: The findings support the potential of MSEs as a tool that occupational therapy practitioners can use to support their clients with IDD who have sensory sensitivities in clinical settings. This article also highlights a multidisciplinary approach whereby medical providers and occupational therapy practitioners could work together in nontraditional ways to support this population."

    "abstract": "The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) keeps rising year by year, and became the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Some studies have found that liraglutide, a GLP-1 analog, may decrease the tumor cells proliferation. Due to this, the aim of this work is to investigate the antiproliferative potential of exenatide, another GLP-1 analog. Cell proliferation was assessed by direct count with Trypan blue dye exclusion. Flow cytometry was used to determinate autophagy and nuclear staining. Morphometric analysis was used to verify senescence and apoptosis. The mechanism that induced cell growth inhibition was analyzed by Western Blot. Treatment with exenatide significantly decreases cell proliferation and increases autophagy, both in relation to control and liraglutide. In addition, mTOR inhibition was greater in cells treated with exenatide. In relation to chronic treatment, exenatide does not allow cellular regrowth by preventing some resistance mechanism that the cells can acquire. These results suggest that exenatide has a potent anti-proliferative activity via mTOR modulation and, among the GLP-1 analogs tested, could be in the future an alternative for HCC treatment."

Evidence concerning child and adolescent mental health has predominantly come from western countries, while the Middle East region, with a large youth population, has reported very little on it. This original, cross-sectional study of child and adolescent psychiatry in the Middle East provides an assessment of current postgraduate programs, services and what is needed to build workforce capacity. Academic psychiatrists from 16 Middle East countries were invited to form a Consortium to map current postgraduate training as one of the determinants of available child and adolescent psychiatry services, identify gaps in the distribution of child and adolescent psychiatrists, and propose potential steps to improve access to child and adolescent mental health care. The study collected data from 15 of the 16 countries invited (no data provided from Yemen). The study revealed underdeveloped child and adolescent psychiatry academic systems throughout the region. Despite recognition of the specialty in a majority of the countries (11/15), only six countries had established a designated child and adolescent psychiatry training program. The overall shortage of child and adolescent mental health specialists varied, yet all Consortium members reported a need for additional child and adolescent psychiatry specialists and allied professionals. Lack of child and adolescent psychiatry specialized programs in place throughout the region has evidently contributed to the shortage of qualified child and adolescent mental health workforce in the Middle East."

    "abstract": "Both high-fat diet and chronic circadian disruption have been associated with increased incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans. Chronically elevated glucocorticoids, which have considerable impacts on physiological processes such as intermediary metabolism, inflammation, and fat metabolism, have also been implicated in insulin resistance associated with obesity and diabetes. In this study, the effects of high-fat diet (HFD) or chronic circadian challenge in C57BL/6J mice on basal and stress-induced corticosterone (CORT) and blood glucose levels were assessed. Baseline and stress-induced levels of CORT, insulin and glucose were measured before and after acute restraint stress at 4 different time points across the light-dark cycle (LD) in male C57BL/6J mice maintained for 8 weeks on HFD or regular chow. After 8 weeks on diet, baseline CORT levels in HFD mice were of similar magnitude but more variable than in mice on low-fat diet, rendering their daily fluctuations arrhythmic according to statistical analysis. Baseline glucose measures were unchanged despite significant 3-fold increases in baseline insulin levels in HFD mice at all time points sampled. Restraint stress yielded considerable decreases in insulin levels and increases in CORT and glucose levels that were significantly exaggerated in the early active period in mice on HFD. These results indicate a circadian influence on stress responses after prolonged consumption of high fat diet. In a separate experiment, C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 6 weeks of an alternating light-dark (LD) cycle comprised of 6 h advances and delays of phase every 5 days to keep the circadian system from establishing consistent circadian entrainment, with a control group of mice under a regular 12:12 LD cycle. While body weights were not significantly affected by chronic circadian challenge, the basal CORT rhythm in alternating-LD mice was significantly dampened. Stress-induced CORT in alternating LD were no different from regular LD group with the exception of ZT 18, at which time the stress response was moderately suppressed compared to controls. These results support that high-fat diet may be contributing to health disorders such as obesity and diabetes in a manner different from any effects of chronic circadian disruption."

It pervades and plagues contemporary society; it has been estimated that there are up to 35 million users worldwide. METH is a highly addictive psychotropic compound which acts on the central nervous system, and chronic use can induce psychotic behavior. METH has the capacity to modulate immune cells, giving the drug long-term effects which may manifest as neuropsychiatric disorders, and that increase susceptibility to communicable diseases, such as HIV. In addition, changes to the cytokine balance have been associated with compromise of the blood-brain barrier, resulting to alterations to brain plasticity, creating lasting neurotoxicity. Immune-related signaling pathways are key to further evaluating how METH impacts host immunity through these neurological and peripheral modifications. Combining this knowledge with current data on inflammatory responses will improve understanding of how the adaptive and innate immunity responds to METH, how this can activate premature-ageing processes and how METH exacerbates disturbances that lead to non-communicable age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, depression and dementia."

A similar search was conducted on 5 types of cancer. The reliability of the information presented was rated on a 3-level scale (A, B, or C). Level A referred to reliable sites (providing information complying with the clinical practice guidelines for various types of cancer), Level B included sites not falling under either Level A or Level C, and Level C comprised dangerous or harmful sites (providing information on treatment not approved by the regulatory authority in Japan and bombastic advertisements without any relevant clinical evidence). The evaluation was conducted by medical oncologists, medical students, and cancer survivors. The consistency of the information reliability level rating between the medical students or cancer survivors with that of the medical oncologists was assessed by using the kappa value.\nResults: A total of 247 sites were evaluated for reliability.

    "abstract": "Carotenoids are naturally occurring pigments of autotroph organisms that have been related to many health benefits and this is not only because some of them are precursors of vitamin A. Individual or whole carotenoid consumption has been associated with a lower risk of developing cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases among others. However, the blood levels of carotenoids vary largely from person to person due to different factors. Diet is the most important one because of the dietary patterns that different populations follow, the time of the year of consumption or the personal preferences. Nevertheless, the intrinsic host factors such as the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion genetic polymorphisms, the volume of distribution and the person's microbiota and others such as carotenoid interactions are also inducing this so called inter-individual variability. Besides, culinary methods and processing produce changes in the foods that directly affect carotenoid content and hence their blood profile. Different types of studies have been performed to understand the between-subject variation of the carotenoid profile in human plasma. This research is focused on this matter as levels of carotenoids in human plasma could be useful for the prediction of some diseases. The Mediterranean diet is probably the most carotenoid rich diet stemming from its high proportion of fruits and vegetables. Its differences with other diets and the effect on the carotenoid blood profile of the consumers are currently a very interesting topic of study."

    "abstract": "Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin mostly induced by Merkel cell polyomavirus integration. Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) positivity is currently used to distinguish Merkel cell carcinomas from other neuroendocrine carcinomas. However, this distinction may be challenging in CK20-negative cases and in cases without a primary skin tumor. The objectives of this study were first to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of previously described markers for the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma and second to validate these markers in the setting of difficult-to-diagnose Merkel cell carcinoma variants. In a preliminary set (n = 30), we assessed optimal immunohistochemical patterns (CK20, thyroid transcription factor 1 [TTF-1], atonal homolog 1 [ATOH1], neurofilament [NF], special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 [SATB2], paired box protein 5, terminal desoxynucleotidyl transferase, CD99, mucin 1, and Merkel cell polyomavirus-large T antigen) and Merkel cell polyomavirus load thresholds (real-time PCR). The diagnostic accuracy of each marker was then assessed in a validation set of 103 Merkel cell carcinomas (9 CK20-negative cases and 15 cases without a primary skin tumor) and 70 extracutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma cases. The most discriminant markers for a diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma were SATB2, NF expression, and Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA detection (positive likelihood ratios: 36.6, 44.4, and 28.2, respectively). Regarding Merkel cell carcinoma variants, cases without a primary skin tumor retained a similar immunohistochemical profile and CK20-negative tumors displayed a different profile (decrease frequency of NF and SATB2 expression), but Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA remained detected (78% of cases by qPCR). Moreover, 8/9 (89%) CK20-negative Merkel cell carcinoma cases but only 3/61 (5%) CK20-negative extracutaneous neuroendocrine cases were positive for at least one of these markers. In conclusion, detection of SATB2 and NF expression and Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA helps distinguish between Merkel cell carcinoma classical and variant cases and extracutaneous neuroendocrine carcinomas."

    "abstract": "Aim: Primary cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma, or Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), cannot be distinguished morphologically from small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (SmCC) from other sites. Immunohistochemistry is required to confirm cutaneous origin, and is also used for detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases of MCC. Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) expression is commonly used for these purposes, but is negative in some MCC cases, and has unclear specificity. We evaluated immunohistochemistry for neurofilament and CK20 in MCC compared with SmCC from other sites.\nMethods and results: We evaluated neurofilament expression in 55 MCC specimens from 39 unique patients, including nine CK20-negative MCC tumours. Neurofilament expression was observed in 42 of 55 (76.4%) MCC cases, including seven of nine (77.8%) CK20-negative MCC cases. Neurofilament was expressed in nine of 12 (75%) Merkel cell polyomavirus-positive tumours and five of 10 (50%) virus-negative tumours. Compared to a standard immunohistochemical panel (cytokeratin cocktail and CK20), neurofilament was 87.5% sensitive for detecting SLN metastases. Neurofilament and CK20 expression was also assessed in 61 extracutaneous SmCC from 60 unique patients, with primary sites including lung (27), bladder (18), cervix (3), gastrointestinal tract (3), sinonasal tract (2) and other sites (7). The specificity of neurofilament and CK20 for MCC versus non-cutaneous SmCC was 96.7% and 59.0%, respectively.\nConclusions: Neurofilament has superior specificity to CK20 in distinguishing MCC from non-cutaneous SmCC. Neurofilament is frequently expressed in CK20- and virus-negative MCC tumours. Limitations of neurofilament immunohistochemistry include lower sensitivity than CK20 and subtle staining in some tumours. However, our findings indicate that neurofilament is useful for excluding non-cutaneous SmCC."

Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.\nResults: With a median follow-up of 52 months, 53 deaths occurred (42 from MCC, 7 unknown, and 4 non-MCC). Two-year PFS, MSS, and OS were 30%, 55%, and 52%, respectively. Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired deficiency syndrome and solid organ transplant patients were diagnosed with MCC at a younger age (median 55 and 59 y, respectively) and with more advanced stage disease compared with other immunosuppressed subgroups. PFS did not significantly differ among the 5 immunosuppression subgroups (P=0.30), but significant differences were observed in MSS and OS (both P=0.01). Controlling for potential confounders for OS, including age and stage, immunosuppression type was still significantly associated with risk of death (P=0.01).\nConclusions: Among immunosuppressed MCC patients, recurrent MCC is the major cause of mortality. The risk of death from MCC differs among immunosuppression types, suggesting important biological differences in host-tumor immune interactions."

    "abstract": "Citrobacter sp. strain TSA-1 is an enteric bacterium isolated from the hindgut of the termite. Strain TSA-1 displays anaerobic growth with selenite, fumarate, tetrathionate, nitrate, or arsenate serving as electron acceptors, and it also grows aerobically. In regards to arsenate, genome sequencing revealed that strain TSA-1 lacks a homolog for respiratory arsenate reductase, arrAB, and we were unable to obtain amplicons of arrA. This raises the question as to how strain TSA-1 achieves As(V)-dependent growth. We show that growth of strain TSA-1 on glycerol, which it cannot ferment, is linked to the electron acceptor arsenate. A series of transcriptomic experiments were conducted to discern which genes were upregulated during growth on arsenate, as opposed to those on fumarate or oxygen. For As(V), upregulation was noted for 1 of the 2 annotated arsC genes, while there was no clear upregulation for tetrathionate reductase (ttr), suggesting that this enzyme is not an alternative to arrAB as occurs in certain hyperthermophilic archaea. A gene-deletion mutant strain of TSA-1 deficient in arsC could not achieve anaerobic respiratory growth on As(V). Our results suggest that Citrobacter sp. strain TSA-1 has an unusual and as yet undefined means of achieving arsenate respiration, perhaps involving its ArsC as a respiratory reductase as well as a detoxifying agent."

    "abstract": "Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an extremely aggressive skin cancer that must be distinguished from other basaloid cutaneous neoplasms that have different treatments and prognoses. This is sometimes challenging in small shave specimens, crushed samples, lymph nodes, and core needle biopsies. Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) immunohistochemistry is a sensitive nuclear marker of neuroendocrine differentiation. INSM1 staining was performed on 56 MCC (47 primary tumors, 9 nodal metastases), 50 skin control cases that included basal cell carcinomas, basaloid squamous cell carcinomas, Bowen disease, sebaceous neoplasms, melanoma, and B-cell lymphomas, and 28 lymph node control cases that included metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms, melanomas, squamous cell carcinomas, lymphomas, and adenocarcinomas. Percent of staining nuclei (0, <25%, 25% to 50%, 50% to 75%, >75%) and intensity (weak, moderate, strong) were recorded for each sample. All 56 MCC expressed INSM1. By comparison, synaptophysin, CK20, and chromogranin were expressed in 96%, 92%, and 32% of MCC, respectively. While the 3 conventional markers showed significant variability in staining intensity and distribution, INSM1 stained >75% tumor nuclei in 89% of MCC and 50% to 75% of tumor nuclei in 11%. Staining intensity was strong in 85% and moderate in 15%. None of the 50 cutaneous basaloid non-MCC neoplasms in the control group stained with INSM1, and among the lymph node controls 5 of 5 neuroendocrine neoplasms expressed INSM1, confirming that INSM1 staining cannot distinguish MCC from metastatic extracutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma. INSM1 holds promise as a neuroendocrine marker that can distinguish MCC from its mimickers in the skin and improve detection of sentinel lymph node metastases."

    "abstract": "Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare (∼2,000 U.S. cases/year) but aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin. For advanced MCC, cytotoxic chemotherapy only infrequently (<10% of cases) offers durable clinical responses (>1 year), suggesting a great need for improved therapeutic options. In 2008, the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) was discovered and is clonally integrated in approximately 80% of MCC tumors. The remaining 20% of MCC tumors have large numbers of UV-associated mutations. Importantly, both the UV-induced neoantigens in virus-negative tumors and the MCPyV T antigen oncogenes that are required for virus-positive tumor growth are immunogenic. Indeed, antigen-specific T cells detected in patients are frequently dysfunctional/\"exhausted,\" and the inhibitory ligand, PD-L1, is often present in MCC tumors. These findings led to recent clinical trials involving PD-1 pathway blockade in advanced MCC. The combined data from these trials involving three PD-1 pathway blocking agents-avelumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab-indicated a high frequency of durable responses in treated patients. Of note, prior treatment with chemotherapy was associated with decreased response rates to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Over the past year, these striking data led to major changes in advanced MCC therapy, including the first-ever FDA drug approval for this disease. Despite these successes, approximately 50% of patients with MCC do not persistently benefit from PD-1 pathway blockade, underscoring the need for novel strategies to broaden antitumor immune responses in these patients. Here, we highlight recent progress in MCC including the underlying mechanisms of immune evasion and emerging approaches to augment the efficacy of PD-1 pathway blockade.

However, whether there are sex specific differences in arterial telomere uncapping is unknown. We found that telomere uncapping (serine 139 phosphorylated histone γ-H2A.X in telomeres) in arteries was ~2.5 fold greater in post-menopausal women (n=17, 63±2 years) compared with pre-menopausal women (n=11, 30±2 years, p=0.02), while there was only a trend towards greater telomere uncapping in older men (n=26, 66±2 years) compared with young men (n=11, 31±2, p=0.11). Senescence markers, p53 bound to the p21 gene promoter and p21 gene expression, were 3-4 fold greater in post-menopausal compared with pre-menopausal women (p=0.01-0.02), but only 1.5-2 fold greater in older compared with young men (p=0.02-0.08). Blood glucose was related to telomere uncapping in women, while systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure and serum creatinine were related to telomere uncapping in men. Mean arterial telomere length decreased similarly in women and men with age (p<0.01). Thus, the age-related increase in arterial telomere uncapping and senescence is greater in women than men, despite similar age-related reductions in mean telomere length in both sexes."

Patients were assessed before (day 0) and after (days 15, 30, and 90) treatment for elbow pain (using a visual analogue scale [VAS]), function (using the patient-rated tennis elbow evaluation [PRTEE] questionnaire), and grip strength (using a hydraulic hand dynamometer). Patients were followed up at 6 months by telephone to assess elbow pain using the VAS.\nResults: No complications (infection, skin atrophy, neurovascular damage, or tendon rupture) were noted. 10 patients reported increased pain for up to 2 days after autologous blood injection. In both groups, the VAS score for elbow pain, PRTEE score, and grip strength improved significantly after treatment (p=0.0001), but the pattern of improvement differed. Compared with autologous blood injection, corticosteroid injection improved all 3 scores at a faster rate over the first 15 days (p=0.0001), and then started to decline slightly until day 90. After autologous blood injection, all 3 scores improved steadily and were eventually better (p=0.0001). If a 37% decrease in PRTEE is defined as complete recovery, 38 (95%) of patients with autologous blood injection and 25 (62.5%) of patients with corticosteroid injection achieved complete recovery (p=0.0001).\nConclusion: Autologous blood injection was more effective over the follow-up period than corticosteroid injection in improving pain, function, and grip strength. It is recommended as a first-line injection treatment because it is simple, cheap, and effective."

In the simple scenario of a liquid cell interior, the surface tension is related to the local curvature and the hydrostatic pressure difference by Laplace's law. However, verification of this scenario for cells requires accurate measurements of cell shape. Here, we use wedged micro-cantilevers to uniaxially confine single cells and determine confinement forces while concurrently determining cell shape using confocal microscopy. We fit experimentally measured confined cell shapes to shapes obeying Laplace's law with uniform surface tension and find quantitative agreement. Geometrical parameters derived from fitting the cell shape, and the measured force were used to calculate hydrostatic pressure excess and surface tension of cells. We find that HeLa cells increase their internal hydrostatic pressure excess and surface tension from ≈ 40 Pa and 0.2 mNm(-1) during interphase to ≈ 400 Pa and 1.6 mNm(-1) during metaphase. The method introduced provides a means to determine internal pressure excess and surface tension of rounded cells accurately and with minimal cellular perturbation, and should be applicable to characterize the mechanical properties of various cellular systems."

The sample was dichotomized into individuals who had attempted suicide (n = 18) and those who had not (n = 32). We examined the relationship between predictor variables and previous attempts, and compared the services that both groups are currently receiving.\nResults: Over 35% of individuals with AS reported that they had attempted suicide in the past. Individuals who attempted suicide were more likely to have a history of depression and self-reported more severe autism symptomatology. Those with and without a suicidal history did not differ in terms of the services they were currently receiving. This study looks at predictors retrospectively and cannot ascertain how long ago the attempt was made. Although efforts were made to obtain a representative sample, there is the possibility that the individuals surveyed may be more or less distressed than the general population with AS.\nConclusion: The suicide attempt rate in our sample is much higher than the 4.6% lifetime prevalence seen in the general population. These findings highlight a need for more specialized services to help prevent future attempts and to support this vulnerable group."

Few published studies have used comprehensive patient data and long-term follow-up to examine factors that predict MCC outcomes.\nObjective: To characterize MCC in a large defined-population cohort and analyze predictors of disease recurrence and survival.\nSetting, design, and participants: Retrospective cohort study of 218 patients with MCC from the cancer registry of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care delivery system. Patients were diagnosed as having MCC and followed up from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2009. We examined host (age, sex, race, and immunosuppression), tumor (anatomic site, size, and extent), diagnostic (results of imaging and pathologic nodal evaluation), and treatment (surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy) variables for their association with MCC outcomes.\nExposure: Host, tumor, diagnostic, and treatment factors.\nMain outcomes and measures: Recurrence (locoregional and distant) of MCC and patient survival (overall and MCC specific).\nResults: We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) and 95% CIs for outcomes using Cox proportional hazards regression models. After adjustment for host, tumor, diagnostic, and treatment variables, tumor extent (categorized as local, regional, and distant) remained significantly associated with all outcomes. Immunosuppression was associated with higher MCC-specific mortality (AHR, 4.9 [95% CI, 1.7-14.4]), and an unknown primary site was associated with a lower risk for distant metastasis (0.1 [0.0-0.7]) and improved survival (0.4 [0.2-0.9]). Pathological nodal evaluation was associated with a lower risk for metastasis (AHR, 0.2 [95% CI, 0.0-1.0]) and improved survival. Radiation treatment was associated with a decreased risk for locoregional recurrence (AHR, 0.3 [95% CI, 0.1-0.6]), whereas chemotherapy was not associated with any alteration in outcomes.\nConclusions and relevance: Tumor site and extent, results of pathologic nodal evaluation, and the presence of radiation treatment were associated with MCC recurrence. Immunosuppression, tumor extent, and results of pathologic nodal evaluation were associated with MCC-specific survival, whereas chemotherapy was not associated with any outcomes. Our findings may help to inform diagnostic and therapeutic management of MCCs."

This review evaluates both the consistency and the quality of epidemiologic evidence testing the hypothesis that ATR exposure, at usually encountered levels, is a risk factor for birth defects, small for gestational age birth weight, prematurity, miscarriages, and problems of fetal growth and development. We followed the current methodological guidelines for systematic reviews by using two independent researchers to identify, retrieve, and evaluate the relevant epidemiologic literature on the relation of ATR to various adverse outcomes of birth and pregnancy. Each eligible paper was summarized with respect to its methods and results with particular attention to study design and exposure assessment, which have been cited as the main areas of weakness in ATR research. As a quantitative meta-analysis was not feasible, the study results were categorized qualitatively as positive, null, or mixed. The literature on ATR and pregnancy-related health outcomes is growing rapidly, but the quality of the data is poor with most papers using aggregate rather than individual-level information. Without good quality data, the results are difficult to assess; however, it is worth noting that none of the outcome categories demonstrated consistent positive associations across studies. Considering the poor quality of the data and the lack of robust findings across studies, conclusions about a causal link between ATR and adverse pregnancy outcomes are not warranted."

Conventional flap reconstruction often involves the sacrifice of a source artery and muscle, resulting in significant donor morbidity. Perforator flaps sought to overcome this but required tedious dissection. In this article, the authors introduce a new concept in perineal reconstruction using perforator-based island flaps.\nMethods: The perineal perforator-based island flap is raised based on perforators that most commonly arise from the perineal artery. The flap is designed in the inguinal and gluteal folds in order to achieve aesthetic, tension-free primary closure of the donor site. Eleven patients underwent perineal reconstruction using this approach. Patients ranged in age from 8 to 75 years, with a female-to-male ratio of 10:1.\nResults: All 11 operations were performed by a single surgeon (S.Y.M.H.). There were no cases of flap loss or donor-site complications, as defined by wound infection, dehiscence, or keloid formation. All 11 patients reported excellent satisfaction with regard to donor-site aesthetics.\nConclusions: Perineal perforator-based island flaps represent one of the most successful outcomes of the perforator concept. There is no sacrifice of donor vessels or muscle and minimal donor morbidity. The flap is also easily harvested and allows for challenging free-form flap design because it is based on reliable perforators.\nClinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, IV."

It is initiated by complex subgingival biofilms, triggering an inflammatory response by the juxtaposed gingival tissue. The range of transcriptional events initiated in the gingiva following biofilm challenge is not fully elucidated. By employing gene microarray technology, this study aimed to characterize the overall transcriptional changes (more than two-fold regulation) of cultured human gingival fibroblasts in response to a 10-species in vitro subgingival biofilm model (BF), over a challenge period of 6 h. The relative involvement of the three 'red complex' species in these transcriptional events was evaluated by omitting these species from the biofilm composition (BF-RC). When compared with the unchallenged control, challenge with BF and BF-RC differentially regulated 386 and 428 genes, respectively, with an overlap of 52-75%. Interestingly, the expression of only three genes was significantly different between the BF and BF-RC challenged groups. There was also a strong overlap of the affected signalling pathways and gene ontology processes. These signalling pathways involved primarily the immune response, and included toll-like receptors, interleukin-1, interleukin-17 and heat-shock proteins 60 and 70. In conclusion, subgingival biofilms elicited a large number of transcriptional changes in gingival fibroblasts, while the presence of the 'red complex' in the biofilm did not yield any substantial differences. These findings show a uniform 'non-specific' transcriptional response of host cells to subgingival biofilms, and denote that redundancies may exist in the virulence properties of individual bacterial species within a polymicrobial biofilm community."

The cardinal motor symptoms of the disease result from the loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the midbrain. There is currently no cure for PD and improved methods for modelling the disease are required in order to develop more effective therapeutic interventions. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carry the genetic background of the donor, enabling accurate modelling of genetic diseases in vitro. Various human iPSCs from patients suffering different genetic forms of PD have been differentiated into DA neurons and demonstrated signs of the pathophysiology of PD in vitro. The examination of key cellular pathways such as calcium regulation and autophagy indicate that disease-associated genetic variants may have important implications for cellular function. This review examines and critiques how DA neurons from patient iPSCs have been used to model PD in vitro, and what iPSCs might hold for the future of PD research.

The elevated iron levels observed in the substantia nigra of PD subjects have been suggested to incite the generation of reactive oxygen species and intracellular α-synuclein aggregation, terminating in the oxidative neuronal destruction of this brain area. Thus, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in iron dysregulation and oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration is a crucial step in deciphering PD pathology and in developing novel iron-complexing compounds aimed at restoring brain iron homeostasis and attenuating neurodegeneration. This review discusses the involvement of dysregulation of brain iron homeostasis in PD pathology, with an emphasis on the potential effectiveness of naturally occurring compounds and novel iron-chelating/antioxidant therapeutic hybrid molecules, exerting a spectrum of neuroprotective interrelated activities: antioxidant/monoamine oxidase inhibition, activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 signaling pathway, induction of HIF-1 target iron-regulatory and antioxidative genes, and inhibition of α-synuclein accumulation and aggregation."

By reprogramming cells from patients carrying disease-associated mutations, and subsequent differentiation into the cell type of interest, researchers now have the opportunity to study disease-specific cell types which were previously inaccessible. In the case of PD (Parkinson's disease), reprogramming is advancing rapidly, and cell lines have been generated from patients carrying mutations in several disease-associated genes, including SNCA (α-synuclein), PARK2 (parkin), PINK1 (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10-induced putative kinase 1), PARK7 (DJ-1) and LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2), as well as idiopathic cases. Functional dopaminergic neurons have been differentiated from these cells and their physiology has been compared with control neurons. Human dopaminergic neurons had been previously inaccessible until post-mortem, when the disease is generally highly progressed into pathology. In comparison, iPSCs provide a living cell model with the potential to study early molecular changes which accumulate in cells and ultimately result in neurodegeneration. Although clear phenotypes have not yet been unambiguously identified in patient-derived dopaminergic neurons, there are suggested aberrations in cellular pathways involved in neurodegeneration. Overall, these cells offer a unique opportunity to study dopaminergic neurons carrying a 'Parkinsonian genome'. The present review discusses the advances in cellular reprogramming technologies and studies that have been carried out on PD-derived iPSCs and differentiated dopaminergic neurons."

In girls, after adjusting for age, ethnicity, parental education, parental history of hypertension, baseline height, baseline blood pressure, change in body mass index, and time spent in physical and sedentary activities, each 1-SD (1-SD = 7.10 g/d) increase in baseline dietary intake of total fiber was associated with a 0.96-, 0.62-, and 0.75-mmHg decrease in mean systolic (P = 0.02), diastolic (P = 0.01), and arterial blood pressures (P = 0.002), respectively, 5 years later. In girls, each 1-SD increase in dietary glycemic index, glycemic load, carbohydrate, and fructose was concurrently related to increases of 1.81 (P = 0.001), 4.02 (P = 0.01), 4.74 (P = 0.01), and 1.80 mm Hg (P = 0.03) in systolic blood pressure, respectively, >5 years. Significant associations between carbohydrate nutrition variables and blood pressure were not observed among boys. Excessive dietary intake of carbohydrates, specifically from high glycemic index/glycemic load foods, could adversely influence blood pressure, particularly in girls, whereas fiber-rich diets may be protective against elevated blood pressure during adolescence."

    "heading": "Mechanisms of cervical spine injury in rugby union: a systematic review of the literature",
    "abstract": "Background: Severe cervical spine injury in rugby union (rugby) exerts a major impact on the individual who sustains the injury and on the broader society. Since the late 1970s, authors of rugby case report studies have postulated that the underlying mechanism of cervical spine injury is hyperflexion of the neck. However, this is in conflict with findings from more recent experimental studies. These have shown that it is more likely that the majority of cervical spine injuries occur due to buckling of the cervical spinal column.\nObjective: To investigate the primary mechanism of cervical spine injury in rugby.\nMethods: A comprehensive and systematic review of the literature was undertaken. Six key factors were identified and subsequently used to investigate the two principally postulated mechanisms of cervical spine injury: hyperflexion and buckling.\nResults: Facet dislocations, in particular bilateral facet dislocations, were identified as the most common types of cervical spine injury in rugby. Trauma occurred most often at lower cervical spinal levels, notably the C4/5 and C5/6 motion segments. Experimental studies demonstrate that bilateral facet dislocations occurring at the lower cervical spinal levels are primarily produced via buckling.\nConclusion: Our analysis of key factors for cervical spine injury in rugby shows that it is unlikely that the majority of injuries occur after hyperflexion of the neck. It appears more likely that they are the result of buckling of the cervical spinal column."

    "abstract": "Our novel multimodal brain-permeable iron-chelating compounds M30 and HLA20 were demonstrated to possess neuroprotective/neurorescue activities in vitro and in vivo against several insults applicable to various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neuroprotection by iron chelators has been widely recognized with respect to their ability to prevent reactive oxygen species generation in the Fenton reaction by sequestering redox-active iron. An additional neuroprotective mechanism of iron-chelating compounds is associated with their ability to regulate the transcriptional activator hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 is a 'master switch' being an important physiological response mechanism, likely enhancing neuroprotective compensatory pathways involved in many physiological processes within the brain. This mini-review will discuss the multifunctional mechanisms of action of the drugs, M30 and HLA20 in preclinical models of neurodegeneration with a specific emphasis on their ability to activate the HIF-1 signal transduction pathway."

A 80-year old man, residing in Jinju-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, came to GNUH complaining of foreign body sensation, itching, and pain of the right eye in December 2007. A total of 5 worms (4 females and 1 degenerated) were removed from his right eye. We analyzed characteristics of the total 39 Korean HT cases reported to date, including the present 2 cases. Most of the cases (71.8%) occurred in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do before 2000, and 21 cases (53.8%) were males and 18 (46.2%) were females. The prevalence was higher in younger ages below 30 years (48.7%) than 31-60 years (41.0%) and over 61 years (10.3%). The seasonal prevalence showed a higher incidence in autumn (43.6%) than in other seasons. Most of the cases (94.9%) were conjunctival sac infections and only 2 (5.1%) were intraocular cases. The present 2 HT cases are the first reported cases in Gyeongsangnam-do. Some characteristics of Korean HT cases were analyzed."

    "abstract": "Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors were reported to have therapeutic value in several common neurodegenerative conditions owed to their diverse pharmacological functions in neuron survival. Rasagiline (N-propargyl-1-(R)-aminoindan) is a novel, highly potent irreversible MAO-B inhibitor in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in PD model systems by preventing the formation of reactive oxygen species derived from prevention of derived from oxidation of dopamine by MAO-B and via an antiapoptotic action, which appears to be independent of MAO-B inhibition and related to its embedded N-propargyl moiety. This review reflects on earlier and present evidence supporting a role for rasagiline as a neuroprotective molecule in the treatment of PD."

In the present study, we demonstrate that systemic chronic administration of M30 resulted in up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α protein levels in various brain regions (e.g. cortex, striatum, and hippocampus) and spinal cord of adult mice. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that M30 differentially induced HIF-1α-dependent target genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin (EPO), enolase-1, transferrin receptor (TfR), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and glucose transporter (GLUT)-1. In addition, mRNA expression levels of the growth factors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and three antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD)-1, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)) were up-regulated by M30 treatment in a brain-region-dependent manner. Signal transduction immunoblotting studies revealed that M30 induced a differential enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK kinase (MEK), protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Together, these results suggest that the multifunctional iron chelator M30 can up-regulate a number of neuroprotective-adaptive mechanisms and pro-survival signaling pathways in the brain that might function as important therapeutic targets for the drug in the context of neurodegenerative disease therapy."

    "abstract": "During the last century, the world population has shown a staggering increase in its proportion of elderly members and thus, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (AD and PD, respectively) are becoming an increasing burden. Brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases of the elderly are characterized by oxidative damage, dysregulation of redox metals homeostasis and inflammation, supporting a therapeutic use of antioxidants. Natural plant polyphenols (flavonoids and non-flavonoids) are the most abundant antioxidants in the diet and as such, are ideal nutraceuticals for neutralizing stress-induced free radicals and inflammation. Human epidemiological and new animal data suggest that green and black tea drinking (enriched in a class of flavonoids named catechins) may help protecting the aging brain and reduce the incidence of dementia, AD, and PD. Mechanistic studies on the neuroprotective/neuroregenerative effects of green tea catechins revealed that they act not only as antioxidants metal chelators, but also as modulators of intracellular neuronal signaling and metabolism, cell survival/death genes, and mitochondrial function. Thus, these dietary compounds are receiving significant attention as therapeutic multifunctional cytoprotective agents that simultaneously manipulate various brain targets. The scope of this review is to assess and put into perspective salient features of the beneficial brain action of natural, non-toxic green tea catechins in aging-impaired cognition and neurodegenerative diseases and to discuss a scenario concerning their potential, in drug combination, to target distinct pathologies, in the quest for a disease modifying therapy."

An assessment of within-day repeatability and within-week reproducibility demonstrates that excellent performance is observed with our developed method. Analyses were consistent over a 5 month period. Additional method testing, using spiked serum samples, showed the ability to define metabolite differences between samples from a population and samples spiked with metabolites standards.

Out of a total of more than 1,200 patients included into these trials 217 had a pre-treatment total score < or =20 points on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) and were eligible for our re-analysis. They received 600, 900, or 1,200 mg/day WS 5570 or placebo for 6 weeks. In patients treated with WS 5570 the HAMD total score decreased by averages of 10.8 (600 mg/day), 9.6 (900 mg/day), and 10.7 (1,200 mg/day) points between the pre-treatment baseline value and the end of acute treatment, compared to 6.8 points in the placebo group (p < 0.01 for all pairwise comparisons of WS 5570 against placebo). This corresponded to average relative decreases by 49-57% for WS 5570 and by 36% for placebo. The rates of responders (i.e., patients with a HAMD total score decrease > or =50%) were 73%, 64%, 71%, and 37% for WS 5570 600 mg/day, 900 mg/day and 1,200 mg/day, and placebo, respectively. At the end of acute treatment 57% of the patients treated with WS 5570 600 mg/day, 33% in the 900 mg/day group and 62% in the 1,200 mg/day group, as well as 25% in the placebo group were in remission (HAMD total score < or =7 points). The analysis shows that St. John's wort extract WS 5570 has a meaningful beneficial effect during acute treatment of patients suffering from mild depression and leads to a substantial increase in the probability of remission."

This study was conducted to determine the mortality and predictors that contribute to in-hospital mortality for patients who exhibit CAP and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation.\nMethods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 85 patients with severe CAP as a primary cause of acute respiratory failure, and this required mechanical ventilation in a setting of the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary university hospital between 2000 and 2003.\nResults: The overall in-hospital mortality was 56% (48/85). A Cox-proportional hazard model revealed that the independent predictive factors of in-hospital mortality included a PaCO2 of less than 45 mmHg (p<0.001, relative risk [RR]: 4.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.16-10.33), a first 24-hour urine output of less than 1.5 L (p=0.006, RR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.29-4.66) and a high APACHE II score (p=0.004, RR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.03-1.16).\nConclusions: Acute respiratory failure caused by severe CAP and that necessitates mechanical ventilation is associated with a high mortality rate. Initial hypercapnia and a large urine output favored survival, whereas a high APACHE II score predicted mortality."

As specified by the relevant guideline, the study was preceded by a medication-free run-in phase. For the 6-week treatment, 332 patients were randomized: 123 to WS 5570 600 mg/day, 127 to WS 5570 1200 mg/day, and 82 to placebo. The primary outcome measure was the change in total score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D, 17-item version) between baseline and endpoint. Additional measures included the number of responders, the number of patients in remission, and several other standard rating scales. Efficacy and safety were assessed after 2 and 6 weeks. The design included an interim analysis performed after randomization with the option of early termination.\nResults: After 6 weeks of treatment, mean +/- standard deviation decreases in HAM-D total scores of 11.6 +/- 6.4, 10.8 +/- 7.3, and 6.0 +/- 8.1 points were observed for the WS 5570 600 mg/day, 1200 mg/day and placebo groups, respectively (endpoint analysis). Secondary measures of treatment efficacy also showed that both WS 5570 groups were statistically superior to placebo. Significantly more patients in the WS 5570 treatment groups than in the placebo group showed treatment response and remission. WS 5570 was consistently more effective than placebo in patients with either less severe or more severe baseline impairment. The number of patients who experienced remission was higher in the WS 5570 1200 mg/day group than the WS 5570 600 mg/day group. The incidence of adverse events was low in all groups. The adverse event profile was consistent with the known profile for Hypericum extract preparations.\nConclusion: Hypericum perforatum extract WS 5570 at doses of 600 mg/day (once daily) and 1200 mg/day (600 mg twice daily) were found to be safe and more effective than placebo, with comparable efficacy of the WS 5570 groups for the treatment of mild to moderate major depression."

Pulque intake was measured as part of a dietary assessment that was conducted for 2days/month during pregnancy and early lactation.\nResults: Most mothers consumed pulque during pregnancy (69.0%) and lactation (72.4%). Among pulque drinkers, the average ethanol intake was 125.1 g/week during pregnancy and 113.8 g/week during lactation. Greater pulque intake during lactation, independent of intake during pregnancy, was associated with slower weight and linear growth from 1 to 57 months, and smaller attained size at 57 months. Low-to-moderate pulque intake during pregnancy, in comparison to either nonconsumption or heavy intake, was also associated with greater stature at 57 months.\nConclusions: Pulque intake during lactation may have adversely influenced postnatal growth in this population. Public health interventions are urgently needed in Mexico to reduce heavy intake of pulque by pregnant and lactating women, and to replace intake with foods that provide the vitamins and minerals present in the traditional alcoholic beverage."

We compare TMS with other neurophysiological and neuropsychological research tools and propose that TMS, compared with the classical neuropsychological lesion studies, can make its own unique contribution. As the main focus of this review, we describe the different approaches of combining TMS with functional neuroimaging techniques. We also discuss important shortcomings of TMS, especially the limited knowledge concerning its physiological effects, which often make the interpretation of TMS results ambiguous. We conclude with a critical analysis of the resulting conceptual and methodological limitations that the investigation of functional brain-behavior relationships still has to face. We argue that while some of the methodological limitations of TMS applied alone can be overcome by combination with functional neuroimaging, others will persist until its physical and physiological effects can be controlled."

Via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we determine both the amount of fusion protein presented at the phage surface and the amount of complex formed, the ratio of which is proportional to the affinity. Hence this method enables us to calculate the relative affinities of a large number of mutants. As model systems, we investigated actin-binding motifs conserved in a number of proteins binding monomeric or filamentous actin. The hexapeptide motifs LKKTET, present in thymosin beta4, and LKKEKG, present in the villin headpiece, were mutated, and the variants were analyzed. Study of the positional tolerance allows postulating that the motifs, although similar in primary structures adopt different conformations when bound to actin. In addition, our data show that the second and the fourth amino acid of the thymosin beta4 motif and the first three residues of the villin headpiece motif are most important for actin binding. The latter result challenges the charged crown hypothesis for the villin headpiece filamentous actin interaction."

To investigate the physiological role of SynGAP in the brain, we have generated mutant mice lacking the SynGAP protein. These mice exhibit postnatal lethality, indicating that SynGAP plays a critical role during neuronal development. In addition, cell biological experiments show that neuronal cultures from mutant mice have more synaptic AMPA receptor clusters, suggesting that SynGAP regulates glutamate receptor synaptic targeting. Moreover, electrophysiological studies demonstrated that heterozygous mutant mice have a specific defect in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). These studies show that the regulation of synaptic Ras signaling by SynGAP is important for proper neuronal development and glutamate receptor trafficking and is critical for the induction of LTP."

We examined the impact of Atm deficiency as a function of progressive telomere attrition at both the cellular and whole-organism level in mice doubly null for Atm and the telomerase RNA component (Terc). These compound mutants showed increased telomere erosion and genomic instability, yet they experienced a substantial elimination of T-cell lymphomas associated with Atm deficiency. A generalized proliferation defect was evident in all cell types and tissues examined, and this defect extended to tissue stem/progenitor cell compartments, thereby providing a basis for progressive multi-organ system compromise, accelerated ageing and premature death. We show that Atm deficiency and telomere dysfunction act together to impair cellular and whole-organism viability, thus supporting the view that aspects of A-T pathophysiology are linked to the functional state of telomeres and its adverse effects on stem/progenitor cell reserves."

    "abstract": "Objective: To assess the effects of an intervention programme designed to increase use of hip protectors in elderly people in nursing homes.\nDesign: Cluster randomised controlled trial with 18 months of follow up.\nSetting: Nursing homes in Hamburg (25 clusters in intervention group; 24 in control group).\nParticipants: Residents with a high risk of falling (459 in intervention group; 483 in control group).\nIntervention: Single education session for nursing staff, who then educated residents; provision of three hip protectors per resident in intervention group. Usual care optimised by brief information to nursing staff about hip protectors and provision of two hip protectors per cluster for demonstration purposes.\nMain outcome measure: Incidence of hip fractures.\nResults: Mean follow up was 15 months for the intervention group and 14 months for the control group. In total 167 residents in the intervention group and 207 in the control group died or moved away. There were 21 hip fractures in 21 (4.6%) residents in the intervention group and 42 hip fractures in 39 (8.1%) residents in the control group (relative risk 0.57, absolute risk difference -3.5%, 95% confidence interval -7.3% to 0.3%, P=0.072). After adjustment for the cluster randomisation the proportions of fallers who used a hip protector were 68% and 15% respectively (mean difference 53%, 38% to 67%, P=0.0001). There were 39 other fractures in the intervention group and 38 in the control group.\nConclusion: The introduction of a structured education programme and the provision of free hip protectors in nursing homes increases the use of protectors and may reduce the number of hip fractures."

    "abstract": "Why do some people have superior memory capabilities? We addressed this age-old question by examining individuals renowned for outstanding memory feats in forums such as the World Memory Championships. Using neuropsychological measures, as well as structural and functional brain imaging, we found that superior memory was not driven by exceptional intellectual ability or structural brain differences. Rather, we found that superior memorizers used a spatial learning strategy, engaging brain regions such as the hippocampus that are critical for memory and for spatial memory in particular. These results illustrate how functional neuroimaging might prove valuable in delineating the neural substrates of mnemonic techniques, which could broaden the scope for memory improvement in the general population and the memory-impaired."

    "abstract": "Field-collected specimens of all known taxa in the Anopheles gambiae complex were analyzed on the basis of chromosome inversions with reference to a standard polytene chromosome map. The phylogenetic relationships among the seven described species in the complex could be inferred from the distribution of fixed inversions. Nonrandom patterns of inversion distribution were observed and, particularly on chromosome arm 2R, provided evidence for genetically distinct populations in A. gambiae, A. arabiensis, and A. melas. In A. gambiae from Mali, stable genetic differentiation was observed even in populations living in the same region, suggesting a process of incipient speciation which is being confirmed by studies with molecular markers. The possible role of chromosome differentiation in speciation of the A. gambiae complex and in the emergence of distinct chromosomal forms within the nominal species is discussed in relation to human malaria."

    "abstract": "Objective: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 375 patients the authors investigated the antidepressant efficacy and safety of 300 mg t.i.d. of hydroalcoholic Hypericum perforatum extract WS 5570.\nMethod: The study participants were male and female adult outpatients with mild to moderate major depression (single or recurrent episode, DSM-IV criteria). After a single-blind placebo run-in phase, the patients were randomly assigned, 186 to WS 5570 and 189 to placebo, after which they received double-blind treatment for 6 weeks. Follow-up visits were held after 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the total score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. In addition, analyses of responders (patients with at least a 50% reduction in Hamilton total score) and patients with remissions (patients with a total score of 6 or less on the Hamilton scale at treatment end) were carried out, and subscale/subgroup analyses were conducted. The design included an adaptive interim analysis performed after random assignment of 169 patients with options for group size adjustment or early termination.\nResults: Compared to placebo, WS 5570 produced a significantly greater reduction in total score on the Hamilton depression scale and significantly more patients with treatment response or remission. It was more effective in patients with higher baseline Hamilton scores and led to global reduction of depression-related core symptoms, assessed with the melancholia subscale of the Hamilton scale. The placebo and WS 5570 groups had comparable adverse events.\nConclusions: H. perforatum extract WS 5570 was found to be safe and more effective than placebo for the treatment of mild to moderate depression."

    "heading": "Dissimilatory arsenate reductase activity and arsenate-respiring bacteria in bovine rumen fluid, hamster feces, and the termite hindgut",
    "abstract": "Abstract Bovine rumen fluid and slurried hamster feces completely reduced millimolar levels of arsenate to arsenite upon incubation under anoxic conditions. This activity was strongly inhibited by autoclaving or aerobic conditions, and partially inhibited by tungstate or chloramphenicol. The rate of arsenate reduction was faster in feces from a population of arsenate-watered (100 ppm) hamsters compared to a control group watered without arsenate. Using radioisotope methods, arsenate reductase activity in hamster feces was also detected at very low concentrations of added arsenate ( approximately 10 muM). Bacterial cultures were isolated from these materials, as well as from the termite hindgut, that grew using H(2) as their electron donor, acetate as their carbon source, and arsenate as their respiratory electron acceptor. The three cultures aligned phylogenetically either with well-established enteric bacteria, or with an organism associated with feedlot fecal wastes. Because arsenite is transported across the gut epithelium more readily than arsenate, microbial dissimilatory reduction of arsenate in the gut may promote the body's absorption of arsenic and hence potentiate its toxicity."

    "abstract": "Background: Drug use patterns among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have been studied in the general population but not specifically in the Medicaid population.\nObjective: The purpose of this study was to examine antihyperglycemic drug use patterns among Medicaid recipients with type 2 diabetes and assess patients' persistence and compliance with different antihyperglycemic drug regimens.\nMethods: Pharmaceutical claims data from Medi-Cal for January 1996 through September 1998 were analyzed to investigate antihyperglycemic drug use patterns over a 1-year and 2-year period. Prescription refill data were examined to assess patient compliance and persistence.\nResults: Of the 37,431 patients in the 1-year follow-up cohort, 79.6% started antihyperglycemic treatment with monotherapy (ie, drug therapy with a single class of antihyperglycemic medication), 14.5% with insulin alone, 3.9% with polytherapy (ie, drug therapy with > or = 2 classes of medication other than insulin), and 2.1% with insulin plus another therapy. Of the patients receiving monotherapy, 85.3% were taking a sulfonylurea, 14.0% were taking metformin, and 0.7% were taking another agent. In the 1-year follow-up, 55.5% of patients taking metformin alone, 67.2% of those taking sulfonylurea alone, and 83.9% of those taking metformin plus sulfonylurea (M + S) did not undergo any modification of their regimen (except discontinuation of therapy). Among these patients, those taking metformin or sulfonylurea alone had approximately 65% more days of continuous (or persistent) treatment (129 and 128 days, respectively) per patient per year than did patients taking polytherapy (78 days). In addition, sulfonylurea or metformin monotherapy was associated with a 36% higher compliance rate than M + S polytherapy (177 days vs 130 days).\nConclusion: Simple 1-drug antihyperglycemic regimens were associated with better compliance and persistence (as measured by prescription refill data) than more complex multiple-drug regimens among patients with type 2 diabetes in the Medi-Cal population."

    "abstract": "Objectives: To document the consumption during pregnancy of pulque, a traditional central Mexican alcoholic beverage, and its relationship to subsequent infant size, physical growth and performance on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.\nDesign: Prospective cohort study.\nSetting: Six villages in rural, central Mexico in 1984-1985.\nSubjects: Seventy mother-infant pairs.\nResults: Most women (72.9%) consumed pulque during pregnancy, and 28.6% consumed more than 150 g ethanol week(-1) from the beverage. Individuals who consumed pulque showed no compensating decrease in energy obtained from other foods. Pulque consumption possessed curvilinear relationships with both infant length (at 1 and 6 months) and Bayley mental performance (at 6 months). Heavy pulque intakes were associated with smaller infant size and poorer mental performance. In modest quantities, pulque consumption may have been beneficial due to its micronutrient content.\nConclusions: Intakes of alcohol from pulque were common among pregnant women in these rural, central Mexican villages. Given current scientific knowledge of the adverse effects of ethanol on foetal development, public health interventions are needed to reduce heavy pulque consumption during pregnancy in some areas of rural Mexico."

    "heading": "Does body stability depend on postural chain mobility or stability area?",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine whether postural stability depends only on the support base perimeter, that is the stability area, when body balance is perturbed by respiration. To this end, seven normal subjects were asked to breathe quietly, breathe deeply and to hold their breath (apnoea). They were asked to maintain a standing posture (Sta), and two sitting postures differing by the ischio femoral contact with the seat (Sit100 and Sit30). In other words, these three postures differed not only by the stability area, but also by pelvis mobility. The thoracic perimeter, displacement of the centre of pressure (CP) and iliac crest acceleration (Ah), taken as an index of pelvis mobility, of seven normal subjects were recorded. The results showed that the sway path (SP) was longer in seated subjects than in standing ones, and in Sit100 than in Sit30. The distance between the CP extreme positions (Delta Xp) varied in the opposite direction to SP. Iliac crests and thoracic displacements were shown to be in phase in Sit condition, and did not display any particular pattern in Sta. It was concluded that postural steadiness depends on the postural chain mobility in addition to stability area. As pelvis and lumbar column mobility are related, it is proposed that both contribute to postural chain mobility, owing to respiratory perturbation being compensated."
